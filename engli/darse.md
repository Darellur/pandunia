Introducing yourself
--------------------

### Dialog

☻: **tu si ke?**
= Who are you?  
☺: **mi si yusef. tu si ke?**
= I am Yusef. Who are you?  
☻: **mi si maria. ye si ke?**
= I am Maria. Who is that?  
☺: **ye si mi da doste.**
= That is my friend.  
☻: **ye da nam si ke?**
= What's her name?  
☺: **ye da nam si sara.**
= Her name is Sara.

### Grammar

Pandunia's sentences normally follow the topic-comment structure. 
The topic indicates who or what is being talked about. The comment
tells something about the topic. For instance in **ye si mi da doste**
the topic is the pronoun **ye** (he, she, it), which is followed by
the comment **si mi da doste** (is my friend).

In Pandunia, the word **si** functions like _to be_ in English.
The same word is used for all persons. And to say the opposite, 
simply replace it with **no** (which is the word for _no_).

**ye si sara.**
- She is Sara.  
**ye no sara.**
- She is not Sara.  

**maw si hewan**
- The cat is an animal.  
**dom no hewan**
- The house is not an animal.  

In the same way you can describe yourself by saying **mi** and a word
that describes you.

**mi bon.**
- I'm good.  
**mi man.**
- I'm a man.  
**mi fem.**
- I'm a woman.

Saying hello
------------

**salam**
= Hello!

This is how people greet each other in Pandunia. They say **salam**.
It is used for saying both hello and goodbye.

**salam**
= Bye!

The word **salam** means "greeting". It is originally an Arabic word,
which means _peace_, and it is a common greeting in many parts of the
world, especially in Africa and Asia. Pandunia is a constructed world
language, which borrows words from all parts of the world.

The verb form of **salam** is **salama**, which means "to greet".

**mi salama tu.**
= I greet you.  
**tu salama mi.**
= You greet me.

These are active sentences. In active sentences the subject does the
action to the object. In **mi salama tu** the first word, **mi**, is
the subject, **salama** is the verb (action word), and **tu** is the
object. The order of subject, verb and object is the normal word order
in Pandunia.

> Word order in active sentence: Subject + Verb + Object

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and
**ye** = he, she, it. Note that the pronouns stayed the same in the
previous example sentences. Words never change in Pandunia. They
always stay the same regardless of their position in sentence.

In Pandunia sentences can be made shorter by leaving out pronouns
that are obvious in the present situation.

**mi salama tu!**
= I greet you.  
**salama tu!**
= Greetings to you! (It is obvious that the speaker is the one who greets.)  
**salama!**
= Greetings! (It is obvious that the listeners are greeted.)

The pattern in **salam tu** is convenient for addressing people by
name, kinship term or profession.

**salam toni!**
= Hello, Tony!  
**salam mame!**
= Hello, mother!  
**salam pape!**
= Hello, father!  
**salam xefe!**
= Hello, chief!

Another Pandunia word for greeting is **haló**. It is also a very
international greeting. You can choose freely, which word to use when
you greet people.

**halo'!** - Hello!

Making requests
---------------

### Dialog

☻: **salam!**
= Hello!  
☺: **salam! bita sida.**
= Hello! Please sit!  
☻: **danke.**
= Thank you.  
☺: **bita nyama kafe u cay.**
= Please have some coffee or tea.  
☻: **mi nyama cay. danke.**
= I will have some tea, thank you.  
...  
☺: **bita salama tu da mame!**
= Please tell greetings to your mother.  
☻: **mi salama ye. salam!**
= I will. Bye!  
☺: **salam!**
= Bye!


### Grammar

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and
**ye** = he, she, it. Pandunia is a gender-neutral language. It
doesn't distinguish between sexes in the third person pronoun or any
of the pronouns. All the personal pronouns are present in the
following example sentence.

**mi bita tu salama ye.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.

This sentence has a _pivot structure_. The first verb, **bita** = to
request, addresses **tu** as its object. At the same time **tu**
serves also as the subject of the second verb, **salama** = to greet,
whose object is **ye**. So **tu** has a double role: (1) object of
the first verb and (2) subject of the second verb. Hence, it is the
_pivot_ or hinge between the two verbs.

> Pivot Stucture: Subject + Verb¹ + Object/Subject + Verb² + Object

The pivot structure is a common structure in Pandunia.

Remember that it is allowed to leave out pronouns that are known in
the context. In other words the speaker can safely assume that the
listeners know who he or she is talking about. So it is unnecessary
to keep on repeating them. In this manner phrases can be made shorter.

**mi bita tu salama ye.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.  
**bita salama ye.**
= Please say hello to him/her.

See how the translation of **bita** changed between the two sentences?
The meaning of the word, the concept, did not change, but its use did.
English reflects this change by using different words, to ask and please.
Pandunia can cope with changes like this without resorting to different
words. It is a principle in Pandunia that there is always exactly one
word for one concept. Different words are not created just because the
grammatical role of a concept changes.

The phrase **bita salama ye** has a useful pattern that can be used
for making polite requests.

**bita sida.**
= Please be seated.  
**bita dona kafe.**
= Please give me some coffee.  
**bita dona cay.**
= Please give me some tea.  
**bita nyama cay.**
= Please have some tea.  
**bita safa kamar.**
= Please clean the room.

Commands are introduced with **orda** = to command. They employ the
same pivot structure as requests with **bita**.

**orda dona cay.**
= Give (me) some tea!  
**orda safa kamar.**
= Clean the room!

In practice, direct commands can be also made with just one verb and
a commanding voice.

**safa ye!**
= Clean it!

### Asking questions

Questions that can be answered by saying _yes_ or _no_ have the same
pivot structure as requests with **bita**, which you learned in the
previous lesson. Question sentences are introduced with **eska** = to ask.

**mi eska tu nyama cay.**
= I ask (do) you drink tea.  
**eska tu nyama cay?**
= Do you drink tea?  
**eska nyama cay?**
= Drink tea?

Requests usually concern the one or the ones spoken to, but questions
are often about other people. Therefore the second pronoun is usually
needed. It can be left out only when it is clear who is the topic of
discussion.

**eska ye nyama cay?**
= Does he or she drink tea?  
**eska tu nyama supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
**eska mimen nyama suy?**
= Do we drink water?

Of course common and proper nouns can also be used.

**eska xefe nyama kafe?**
= Does the chief drink coffee?  
**eska pape safa kamar?**
= Does the father clean the room?  
**eska niki baxa pandunia?**
= Does Nicky speak Pandunia?


### Giving answers

Yes/no questions can be answered with **si** = yes, and **no** = no.

– **eska tu nyama supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
– **si.**
= Yes.  
– **eska ye nyama supe?**
= Does she eat soup?  
– **no.**
= No.

Also more complete answers can be given.

= Yes, I drink coffee.

It is also possible to answer yes by repeating the main verb of the question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saying no
---------

In the previous lesson you learned to answer **si** and **no** to
questions. The word **no** is used for denying something. Adding
**no** in front of the verb turns an affirmative sentence to negative.

**mi salama tu.**
= I greet you.  
**mi no salama tu.**
= I do not greet you.

Conceptually negation means the absence or non-existence of the
negated word. In the phrase **mi no salama tu** the negative word
**no** denies the existence of greeting. In Pandunia the negative
word affects the word that follows it. Different scopes of negation
may result depending on the location of the negative word.

**mi bita tu safa kamar.**
= I ask you to clean the room.  
**mi no bita tu safa kamar.**
= I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**mi bita tu no safa kamar.**
= I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The negated word can be of any type: verb, pronoun, noun, adjective
and even numeral.

**ye no ada maw.**
= She doesn't have a cat.  
**ye ada no maw, a waf.**
= She has no cats but dogs.  
**no ye, a mi ada maw.**
= Not she but I have cats.  
**mi ada no un, a dul maw.**
= I have not one but two cats.

More Questions
--------------

To ask questions beginning with _what_, _which_, _how_, _who_ and
_when_, the interrogative pronoun **ke** is normally used. The
question can be made more specific by adding words for person, time,
manner or thing if needed.

> **ye si ke?** = What is that? / Who is (s)he?  
> **ke ren laya?** = Who is coming? (**ren** = person)  
> **ke zaman tu nyama?** = When do you eat? (**zaman** = time)  
> **ke yang dansa?** = How to dance? (**yang** = manner, style)

In Pandunia, questions beginning with _why_ are asked using **koz ke**.

> **tu suku maw koz ke?** = Why do you like cats?

Questions asking about the cause or reason of something, are answered
by adding **koz** before the cause or reason. **koz** is actually a
passive verb meaning _to be caused by_.

> **tu suku maw koz ke?** = Why do you like cats?  
> **koz yemen kaway.** = Because they are cute.

Of course **koz** can also be used to express the cause or reason for
something, even when not answering to a question.

> **mi suku maw koz yemen kaway** = I like cats because they are cute.

Past, present and future
------------------------

### Expressing time

There are no verb conjugations in Pandunia. All verbs have only one
form for all times. In a way they are similar to some English verbs,
such as "to hit", which is the same in all tenses.

**mi darba ye.**
= I hit it.

In Pandunia all verbs are like that! For example, **mi nyama nan**
can mean both "I eat bread" and "I ate bread", but usually only one
or the other meaning makes sense in the context of the discussion.
For example when people talk about that morning's breakfast, the
sentence tells about the past time.

**mi nyama nan na sube nyam.**
= I ate bread for morning meal.

There are also specific time words.

**gang**
= just, recently  
**zay**
= currently, at the moment  
**hay**
= still  
**sun**
= soon  
**wil**
= later, in the future



The adjectives for past, present and future are **pas, zay** and
**wil**. They can be used for modifying nouns.

**sara si mi da pas xefe.**
= Sara is my former boss.  
**yusef si mi da zay xefe.**
= Yusef is my current boss.  
**maria si mi da wil xefe.**
= Maria is my future boss.

The same words are used when you talk about actions and events in time.
Simply put the word before the verb.

**mi pas darba ye.**
= I hit it (in the past).  
**mi zay darba ye.**
= I am hitting it (currently).  
**mi will darba ye.**
= I will hit it (in the future).

Alternatively the time word can be placed last in the sentence.

**mi darba ye pas.**  
**mi darba ye zay.**  
**mi darba ye wil.**

It's also possible to use longer phrases like **na pase** (in the past) etc.

**mi darba ye na pase.**
= I hit it in the past.  
**mi darba ye na zaye.**
= I hit it at present.  
**mi darba ye na wile.**
= I hit it in the future.


It is not necessary to repeat the time expressions all the time. It
would be awkward. It is enough to set the stage once in the beginning
with a time expression. Another time word will not be needed until
the tense changes or until it becomes useful to stress that you are
still talking in the same tense.

**mi pas ada un maw.**
= I had a cat in the past.  
**ye bon maw.**
= It was a good cat.  
**mi ada un waf zay.**
= I have a dog now.

Any expression of time is good for expressing the tense. When one
time expression is present, other markers are not needed.

**mi jenu na nen 2003.**
= I was born in 2003.
**ye safa kamar na badi den.**
= He will clean the room tomorrow.

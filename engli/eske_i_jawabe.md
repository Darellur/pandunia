#### When was Pandunia created?

Creators of Pandunia began to create a language together first in 2005.
Since the beginning the basic idea was to create an evenly global
auxiliary language. Many different structures and ideas were tried
over the years. The name _Pandunia_ was invented already in 2007 but
the language got its "final" form in 2017 – but of course languages
evolve all the time!

#### What does the flag of Pandunia represent?

![](http://www.pandunia.info/bandir/bandir.png "The flag of Pandunia")

The flag of Pandunia represents global equality. There is a symbol of
_the blue planet_ against the background of the dark blue space. The
equality sign is laid over the Earth.

#### Why the mascot of Pandunia is a duck-billed platypus?

Platypus (**batokrote** in Pandunia) is an egg-laying, duck-billed,
beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal that lives in eastern Australia.
It is an unusual creature. That's why the platypus is a fitting
mascot for Pandunia, which is also an unusual mix, a mix of words and
grammar from East and West, from North and South.

Pandunia doesn't fit into any of the traditional types of languages.
Also in that regard it is similar to the platypus, which is of its own type.

## Past, present and future

#### I want to change something in Pandunia. What should I do?

If your change is a small thing, you should try it in practice with
other people and see how it works. If it really is a good change,
other people will accept it and use it.

Creating offshoot languages is very common in the auxiliary language
community. The case of Esperanto is famous. Offshoots of Esperanto
are counted in the hundreds but most people haven't even heard of
them. Esperanto is still the most popular language of its kind.

It is better to have one big language with several dialects than
many competing languages.

#### Which languages have influenced the grammar of Pandunia?

Pandunia has been influenced by both natural and constructed
languages.

- Natural languages with isolating grammar were a useful model. For
  example the pivot structure comes directly from Chinese.
- Works of earlier language makers were inspirational.
    - Esperanto, Ido, Novial etc. were closely examined.
    - Latino sine Flexione, Lingua Sistemfrater and Interglossa all
      have well thought-out isolating grammars.
- Natural contact languages gave many ideas. It is an interesting
  observation that when speakers of different languages come into
  contact, they tend to create extremely simplified grammar to
  overcome the language barrier — no matter how complex languages
  they speak natively.


#### Who made Pandunia?

The main creator of Pandunia is _Risto Kupsala_, a Finn who wants to
help the world communicate better. People from many countries have
helped over the years.



## Auxiliary language

#### What is a worldlang?

A worldlang is a constructed interlanguage that borrows its words,
speech sounds and possibly grammar from different language families
of the world. There are many worldlangs. Some of them are listed
[here](http://www.kupsala.net/risto/tekokieli/worldlangs.html).

#### How does Pandunia differ from other auxiliary languages?

- The vocabulary of Pandunia is evenly global. It consists of Western
  (Greco-Latin) words, Perso-Arabic words, Chinese words and Indian
  words. Many other auxiliary languages use only or mostly Western
  words, which is not ideal for the world language in our opinion.
- Internationality is the main criterion for selecting words to
  Pandunia. All the words of Pandunia are known by many nations in
  some part of the world.
- The grammar of Pandunia is concise but very flexible. Pandunia has
  only a few grammatical structures, which are re-used over and over
  again.
- Pandunia is a truly neutral language. It's not meant to imitate any
  languages, whereas for example Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua are
  intentionally similar to the European languages.

#### Did Esperanto contribute to the birth of Pandunia?

At first Esperanto was an important source of inspiration. However
the influence of Esperanto to the final language is insignificant.
Pandunia has very different structure and vocabulary compared to
Esperanto.

#### Are the makers of Pandunia aware of the history of the IAL movement?

Yes. Here are some of the most important lessons to be learned from
the history of the international auxiliary language (IAL) movement.

- Over 99% of IALs do not survive in the long term.
- Languages that are created without any pre-existing model (so
  called _a priori_ languages) have very low chance of survival.
- Languages that imitate and simplify one or more natural languages
  have some chance of survival.
- Out of a group of many similar languages only one is likely to do
  well.
- Success can be short-lived. (Remember Volapük and Ido.)
- Rational reasons do not explain success. The "best" language
  doesn't necessarily win.
- Large international organizations, such as the UN or the EU, pay
  very little attention to IALs. So it is up to grassroots movements
  to push an IAL to success.


#### Should Pandunia replace English?

Pandunia is not meant to replace English or any other languages.
People have ability to speak several languages and they speak every
language for a different reason. Some people speak one language at
home, another at work and yet another on international travels. We
can imagine a world where English and all other languages will
continue to be spoken, and where Pandunia is spoken as the universal
second language.

In a way, English will never be replaced. Those who speak it today
will speak it tomorrow. But new generations will grow and they will
choose which language(s) they want to speak with each other. So it
will be _another world_ with another world language. Maybe it will be
English, or maybe a new kind of English or maybe something else. The
landscape of languages changes in a natural process. Different
languages were spoken in the past and different languages will be
spoken in the future.

You are free to speak Pandunia, English and any other language that
your heart desires.



## Grammar and vocabulary

#### Why agglutinating structure was chosen for Pandunia?

Different structures were considered and tested during the
development of Pandunia. The main choice was between an agglutinating
and an isolating structure.

1. In an agglutinating language every word can be clearly divided
   into component parts. For example Esperanto word "niaj" (our) is
   made out of three parts: ni- (we), -a- (adjective marker) and -j
   (plural marker).
2. In an isolating language every word consists of just one part. For
   example in Mandarin Chinese the word for "our" consists of three
   separate words: wǒ (first person pronoun), men (plural marker) and
   de (possessive marker). Then they are simply put together:
   wǒmende, 我们的.

Pandunia is a lightly agglutinating language. It uses separate words
to express things like person, number, mood, tense and aspect, which
are typically expressed with inflection in agglutinating and
inflecting languages.

To demonstrate the difference, let's compare the same sentence in
Esperanto (a heavily agglutinating language) and Pandunia. Parts of
word are separated with the vertical bar sign.

    Esperanto: Mi vol|as  vid|i  vi|a|j|n  du  bel|a|j|n  okul|o|j|n  nun.
    Pandunia:  me wol|a   wid|a  ti        dul sundar     yen         zay.
               I  want to see    your      two beautiful  eyes        now.


#### Why is the letter X pronounced like SH?
 
Pandunia follows the phonetic principle. One letter represents
exactly one sound, and one sound is written with exactly one letter.

Traditionally there isn't any dedicated letter for /ʃ/ in the Latin
alphabet. This sound is frequently written by the letter combination
SH in English. Other languages use different letters and letter
combinations such as CH in French, SCH in German, SJ in Swedish, SZ
in Polish, Š in Czech and Ş in Turkish.

However, there is a handful of languages that use the letter X for
/ʃ/. Basque and Maltese do it without exception. Portuguese and
Catalan are less consistent, but X stands for /ʃ/ frequently.
Pandunia word **xampu'** is written almost exactly the same as in Portuguese.
It means _shampoo_.

In the Chinese romanization systen, Pīnyīn, the letter X stands for
/ɕ/ which is close to /ʃ/. Pandunia has many words with X from
Chinese, for example **xim, xin** and **xuxe**.


#### Why is the letter C pronounced like CH?

Actually there are several languages where C is pronounced like
English CH. Some of them are Indonesian, Hausa, Oromo and Rwanda. In
Italian, when C is followed by E or I, it is pronounced /tʃ/. This
pronunciation is attested in loand words from Italian such as _cello_
and _cappuccino_.

On the other hand, the letter C doesn't stand for any dedicated sound
in English. The _hard C_ can be represented by K and the _soft C_ by
S. So it makes sense to drop the H from CH.

#### Shouldn't "salam" mean "peace"?

In many languages, expressions of greeting have something to do with
peace, health or well-being. The origins of Pandunia's word **salam**
can be traced back to Semitic triliteral root SLM, which covers a
variety of meanings including safety, security, peace and health.
Likewise the English word _salutation_ (and French greeting _salut_)
can be traced back to Latin "salus", which means safety, security,
health and well-being.

So the meaning of **salam** is greater than the meaning of peace. It
means well-being in general and you can use it as a general
expression for well-wishing in all kinds of situations, not just when
you meet somebody. See the first lesson in the [phrasebook](fraze.md)
for a lot of examples!


#### Why Pandunia borrows words only from widely spoken languages?

Pandunia has words in common with almost all languages of the world.

About 6500 languages are spoken in the world today. If one word was
taken from each language, there would be 6500 words in the dictionary.
It sounds like enough, doesn't it?

However, it's not so simple. All words are not equal. Some words are
more frequent than others. According to the Zipf's law, the most
frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second
most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent
word, etc. By this rule, only 150 words will account for more than
half of everything that is said and written in any given language.
The rest, 6350 words, would be more or less rare. Many of them would
be hardly ever used! So the value of adding one more source language
gets smaller and smaller.

# Basic words and phrases

## Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for
everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

English speakers will find it easy to make basic sentences in Pandunia as the
word order is generally the same as in English, there are no definite or
indefinite articles, no verb "to be", and no complicated rules about changing
the form of words to express singular and plural or the tense of verbs.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word,
which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you
how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other
new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to
learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you!
Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the
phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone.
Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the
same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on.
As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to
clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over
them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the
language. You can just speak Pandunia!

## Part 1: Greeting and basics

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam**
Hello!

**salam sube!**
Good morning!

**salam den!**
Good day!

**salam xam!**
Good evening!

**salam noce!**
Good night!

**salam nyam!**
Bon appetit!

**salam lay!**
Welcome!

**salam cute!**
Goodbye!

**salam safar!**
Have a safe journey!

**salam son!**
Sleep well!

As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for
well-wishing. Use it any time!

**Salam** is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and
non-religious people in many different countries around the world.

<small>Etymology. **salam** is from Arabic: سَلَام‏ "salām", Hebrew:
שָׁלוֹם‏ "šalom", Turkish: selam, Hindi: सलाम "salām", Swahili: salaam,
Indonesian: selamat.</small>

### mi <small>I, me</small>

**mi sara.**
I'm Sara.

**mi tomas.**
I'm Thomas.

You can introduce yourself simply by saying **mi** and your name. You don't
need a verb for saying it in Pandunia!

**mi salama mame.**
I greet mother.

**mi salama pape.**
I greet father.

The word **salam** is a noun and **salama** is the corresponding verb. The
basic word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object.

**sara salama tomas.**
Sara greets Thomas.

**salam mame!**
Greetings, mother!

**salam pape!**
Greetings, father!

<small>Etymology. **mi**
is from English: me, Italian: mi, Swahili: mimi, Zulu: -mi-.</small>

### tu <small>you</small>

**tu tomas.**
You are Thomas.

**mi salama tu.**
I greet you.

**tu salama mi.**
You greet me.

Pronouns don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **mi** is the
same in subject and object positions while English has two different forms, 'I'
and 'me'.

**mi ama tu.**
I love you.

<small>Etymology. **tu** is from Spanish: tú, Italian: tu, French: tu,
Hindi: तू  (tū), Farsi: تو‏‎ (to), Tajik: ту (tu)".</small>

### ye <small>he, she or it</small>

**ye man.**
He is a man.

**ye fem.**
She is a woman.

**ye aple.**
It is an apple.

**ye** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective
of gender) as well as for things.

**mi salama ye.**
I greet him/her.

<small>Etymology. **ye** is from Lingala: yé, Swahili: yeye, Chichewa: iye,
Zulu: -ye-, Hindi: यह  "ye".</small>

### eska <small>to ask a question</small>

**eska tu tomas?**
Are you Thomas?

**eska tu dotor?**
Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **eska**. It is just a regular
verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply
abbreviated from **mi eska tu dotor.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the
first word.

**eska tu bon?**
How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)  
**mi bon.**
I'm good.  
**eska tu?**
And you?  
**mi no bon.**
I'm not good.

<small>Etymology. **eska**
is from French: est-ce que /ɛskə/, Haitian Creole: èske, English: ask.</small>

### si <small>yes</small>

**eska tu tomas?**
Are you Thomas.

**si, mi tomas.**
Yes, I am Thomas.

**eska ye dotor?**
Is he/she a doctor?

**si, ye dotor.**
Yes, he is a doctor.

The word **si** can be used also for stating something as a fact. Then it is
used in place of "to be".

**mi si tomas.**
I am Thomas.

**tu si sara.**
You are Sara.

**aple si pal.**
The apple is a fruit.

Note: It is necessary to use **si** in the latest phrase because, without it,
the phrase would look like a compound word: **aple pal** (an apple fruit).

<small>Etymology. **si** is from Spanish: sí, Portuguese: sim, Mandarin: 是
"shì", Shanghaiese: 是 "sí".</small>

### no <small>no, not</small>

**mi no sara.**
I'm not Sara.

**mi no dotor.**
I'm not a doctor.

**eska tu bon?**
Are you well?  
**si. mi bon.**
Yes, I'm well.

**eska tu bon?**
Are you well?  
**no, mi no bon.**
No, I'm not well.

You can use **no** to deny anything. It is placed before the word that is
denied.

**ye no salama mi.**
He/she doesn't greet me.

<small>Etymology. **no**
is from English: no, Spanish: no, French: non.</small>

### men <small>people</small>

Add **men** to a singular pronoun to make it plural.

**mimen salama tumen.**
We greet you all.

**tumen salama yemen.**
You greet them.

**yemen salama mimen!**
They greet us.

**mimen fem.**

### ce <small>this</small>

**ce ke? / ke ce?**
What's this?

**ce aple.**
This is an apple.

**ce ros aple.**
This is a red apple.

**ci aple ros.**
This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **ros**, is placed before a noun, it works as a
modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.

**ce ros.**
This is red.


### de <small>that</small>

**mi suku ce i de.**
I like this and that.

**mi suku ci kamis i di pantalon.**
I like this shirt and those pants.

Note: The demonstrative pronouns appear in two forms: **ce** and 
**de** are used as standalone words, while **ci** and **di** are used
before the noun that they point to.

**yemen na ke?**
Where are they?

**yemen na de.**
They are there.

**mimen na ce.**
We are here.


### da <small>'s (possessive particle)</small>

**ce ke?**
What's this?

**ce mi da fon.**
It's my phone.

**ce ke da?**
Whose is this?

**ce mi da.**
It's mine.

Note: Possessive particle **da** is put between the owner and the owned thing.
So **mi da** means "my", **tu da** means "your" and so on.

**ye ke?**
Who's he/she?

**ye si mi da doste.**
He/she is my friend.

**mi si sara da doste.**

<small>Etymology. **da**

Therefore a word like **aple** can refer to one or more apples.

**eska tu nyama kafe?**
Do you drink coffee?

**mi nyama kafe.**
I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **nyama** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at

### wola <small>want</small>

**eska tu wola nyama?**

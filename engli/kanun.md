# Grammar

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Introduction

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in Pandunia. 
However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading this grammar,
for example with the help of a phrasebook and a dictionary.

All language teachers know that a language becomes more difficult to learn
when the student must learn to make distinctions that they are not used to making.
That's why students have difficulties with things like
irregular spelling, case-inflection, mandatory tenses, tones, noun/adjective agreement,
honorific inflection, consonant and vowel harmony, mandatory gender distinctions and so on.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn.
It doesn't have any of the previously mentioned complexities.
Instead, it has a simple and regular grammar, a relatively simple vocabulary, and a simple phonetic spelling.

### 1.2. Word classes

A word class is a group of words that have similar forms and similar use in sentences.
In Pandunia, the word class is often indicated by the ending, especially the last vowel, of a word.
For example, most words that end in **-a** are used as verbs in sentences.

The two major families of word classes are content words and function words.
Content words convey most of information and meaning.
Function words are the necessary words for grammar.
You can't say anything meaningful without content words,
but you need function words to put content words together, especially in long sentences.

In Pandunia, the main classes of content words are: nouns, verbs and modifiers;
and the main classes of function words are: pronouns, determiners, prepositions and postpositions.

The vowel endings indicate the classes of content words as follows:

- **-e** indicates a noun
- **-i** indicates a modifier
- **-a** indicates a forward verb
- **-u** indicates a backward verb

For example, **log-** is the stem for the noun **loge** (_speech_), the modifier **logi** (_spoken_ or _oral_ or _orally_),
the forward verb **loga** (_to speak_), and the backward verb **logu** (_to be spoken_).

The same vowel endings are used also in function words,
and they indicate the classes of function words as follows:

- **-e** indicates a pronoun
- **-i** indicates a determiner
- **-a** indicates a preposition
- **-u** indicates a postposition

For example, **m-** is the stem for the pronoun **me** (_I_) and the determiner **mi** (_my_).

Cardinal numerals don't have any vowel ending.

Proper names are considered to be independent of the stem-and-suffix system in Pandunia.
That's why they don't always have the normal word class endings.
For example, the name of a person called _Marie_ can be **mari** in Pandunia,
and the word shall function as a noun and not as a modifier unlike the form of the word indicates.
Obviously, this can be confusing.
That's why it is recommended that names are modified to use the normal noun endings
or to take the honorary suffix **san** as in **mari-san**.


### 1.3. The basic rules

These are the ten basic rules of Pandunia language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Words consist of a stem and one or more suffixes.
   The last suffix indicates the word class to which the word belongs.
   - Modifiers end in **-i**, ex. **nowi** = new.
   - Forward verbs end in **-a**, ex. **me loga** = I speak.
   - Backward verbs end in **-u**, ex. **le logu** = It is spoken.
   - Nouns end in **-e**, **-ia** or zero.
4. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
5. The adjectives and the adverb have the same form.
   Together they are called modifiers.
   They come before the word that they modify.
   All modifiers, except the most common few, end in **-i**.
    - ex. 1. **rapi loge** = A fast talk.
    - ex. 2. **te rapi loga.** = You talk fast.
6. The verb ending **-a** indicates that the agent of the action is immediately before the verb.
    - ex. **me niama aple.** = I eat apples.
7. The verb ending -u indicates that the recipient of the action is immediately before the verb.
    - ex. **aple niamu.** = Apples are eaten.
8. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb functions as the subject of the next verb.
    - ex. **me plisa te dona pes.** = I ask you to give money.
9. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **me eska te baxa pandunia?** → **eska te baxa pandunia?** = Do
      you speak Pandunia?
    - **me plisa te loga ming.** →  **plisa loga ming.** = Please speak
      clearly.
10. Compound words are created by putting the element words side by side.
   The linking vowel **-o-** is inserted between the elements.
    - ex. **poste** (mail) + **sanduke** (box) → **postosanduke** (mailbox)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Nouns

### 2.1. Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing.
Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant.
So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

**petre**
– a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meze**
– a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kurse**
– a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**suy**
– water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were specified earlier in the discussion or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.

### 2.2. Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in singular and plural.
Number can be mentioned with number words when it is needed.

**kurse**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kurse**
– one chair  
**dul kurse**
– two chairs  
**tin kurse**
– three chairs  
**pol kurse**
– many chairs; chairs


### 2.3. Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine and/or neuter categories).

Some words have _natural gender_.
For example **fem** (woman) is feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to another word,
for example good, bad, big, and fast.

### 3.1. Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun.
In Pandunia, an adjective is a modifier that is before a noun.

**nowi kar**
– new car(s)  
**rapi kar**
– fast car(s)  
**day meze**
– big table(s)  
**gaw meze**
– high table(s)  
**bon kurse**
– good chair(s)

When adjective can be also after the noun.
Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

**kar nowi.**
– The car is new.  
**bagre rapi.**
– The tiger is fast.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

**nowi kar rapi.**
– The new car is fast.

### 3.2 Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia an adverb is a modifier that is before a verb or at the
end of the sentence.

**me _bon_ sona.**
– I well sleep.  
**me sona _bon_.**
– I sleep _well_.  
**te baxa pandunia _bon_.**
– You speak Pandunia _well_.

### 3.3. Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier.
For example **day** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

**day ren**
– a big person  
**lil ren**
– a little person  
**sundar ren**
– a beautiful person

**day sundar ren**
– very beautiful person  
**lil sundar ren**
– somewhat beautiful person

The modifiers can be separated by using **i** (and).

**lil i sundar ren**
– a little and beautiful person

### 3.4. Comparison

Modifiers can be compared.

- **max** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sam** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **ka** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of
comparison.

**me si max bon ka te.**
= I am better than you.  
**te loga sam bon ka me.**
= You speak as well as me.

#### 3.6. Modifier ending

Adjectives end in **-i** by default.
The ending is used always with words that are derived from action roots and thing roots.
Ex. **logi** _oral, spoken_, **suki** _happy_, **kitabi** _written, textual_.

The ending is not used in a handful of description roots that end in a single consonant
that is easy to pronounce.
Ex. **bon** (_good_), **day** (_big_), and **lil** (_small_).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Numerals

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words.
They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

**un xing**
– one star  
**dul xing**
– two stars  
**tin xing**
– three stars  
**xaw xing**
– few stars  
**pol xing**
– many stars

**un day kurse**
– one big chair  
**dul day kurse**
– two big chairs  
**tin bon kurse**
– three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

**fen un**
– the first part (part one)
**fen dul**
– the second part (part two)
**fen tin**
– the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nol**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **dul**
- 3 **tin**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **sem**
- 8 **bal**
- 9 **naw**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another –
exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nol** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un dul**
- 13 **un tin**
- 20 **dul nol**
- 21 **dul un**
- 22 **dul dul**
- 100 **un nol nol** or **hon**
- 101 **un nol un** or **hon un**
- 200 **dul nol nol** or **dul hon**

Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units.
So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1000 **kil**
- 1 000 000 **megi**
- 1 000 000 000 **gigi**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **teri**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peti**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksi**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeti**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yoti**
    
Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about.
For example, the word **sol** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.


## 5. Pronouns

### 5.1. Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

**me**
– I, me  
**te**
– you  
**le**
– he, she, it  
**mome**
– we  
**tote**
– you all  
**lole**
– they

### 5.2. Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**ze**
– self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **ze** is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me wida ze**
– I see myself.  
**le wida ze**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mome wida ze.**
– We see ourselves.

### 5.3. Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronoun is:

**ce**
– this/that one

**me wanta ce.**
– I want this one.  
**le wanta ce.**
– He/she wants that one.

It ends in **-i** when it functions as a modifier
i.e. when it comes before a noun.

**ci maw**
– This cat

### 5.4. Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki**
and it means the same as English _which_ and _how_.

**ki xey?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ki ren?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ki zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  
**ki yang?**
– How? (What manner?)

Also adjectives are questioned with **ki**.

**ki pol?**
– How many?  
**ki long?**
– How long?  
**ki day?**
– How big?  
**ki lil?**
– How small?

**ki day du maw te tena?**
– How big cat do you have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Verbs

### 6.1. Introduction

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.

A verb can involve an agent and a recipient.
The agent performs or "causes" an action,
and the recipient receives or "experiences" the action.

Pandunia has two types of verb:
verbs that end in **-a** and verbs that end in **-u**.
The endings decide the order of the agent and the recipient of the action in the sentence.
So the sentence structure depends on the type of the verb.

Simply put, the ending **-a** means:  
If there is anything right before the verb, it is the agent.  
If there is anything right after the verb, it is the recipient.

And the ending **-u** means:  
If there is anything right before the verb, it is the recipient.  
If there is anything right after the verb, it is the agent.

Consider the following examples:  
**me safa.**
– I clean.  
**me safa kamar.**
– I clean a room.  
**kamar safu.**
– Room is cleaned.  
**kamar safu me.**
– Room is cleaned by me.

As you can see, **-a** and **-u** indicate word orders that are opposite to each other.
That's why verbs with **-a** are called _forward verbs_
and verbs with **-u** are called _backward verbs_.

What follows is a theoretical explanation of how verbs work in Pandunia.
It is not necessary to understand the triangular patterns completely.
You can even skip them at first and go directly to chapter 7.

### 6.2. Forward verbs

Verbs that end in **-a** are called _forward verbs_
because the word orders go _forward_ from the agent via the verb to the recipient.

Verbs that end in **-a** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -a
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    A ← R

#### 6.2.1. Order A1: Agent, verb and recipient

The most common word order in Pandunia is agent-verb-recipient.
In this sentence structure the agent comes first, the verb second, and the recipient third.

    agent-verb-recipient
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    A   R

Examples:  
**me wida lole.**
– I see them.  
**te beka pang.**
– You bake bread.  

#### 6.2.2. Order A2: Recipient, agent and verb

The second structure in this triangle is recipient-agent-verb.
It is frequent in dependant clauses.

    recipient-agent-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    A ← R

Examples:  
**ke te wida?**
– What do you see?  
**me niama pang, da te beka.**
– I eat bread _that you baked._

#### 6.2.3. Order A3: Verb, recipient and agent

The third structure of this triangle is the verb-recipient-agent, which is rarely used.
It is described here only for the sake of completeness.

    verb-recipient-agent
    
      V
       ↘
    A ← R

### 6.3.Backward verbs

Verbs that end in **-u** are called _backward verbs_
because the word orders go _backward_ from the recipient via the verb to the agent.

Verbs that end in **-u** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -u
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    R ← A

#### 6.3.1. Order U1: Recipient, verb and agent

The recipient-verb-agent order is common in sentences where the subject is a passive recipient.

    recipient-verb-agent
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    R   A

Often they can be translated to English by using the passive voice or an intransitive verb
but sometimes a transitive verb can be used too.

Examples:  
**pang beku te.**
– Bread is baked by you.  
**pakse domu arbe.**
– Birds live (in) trees.  
**te suku me.**
– You are pleased by me. (Or: You like me.)

#### 6.3.2. Order U2: Agent, recipient and verb

The agent-recipient-verb order is commonly used alternative for the agent-verb-recipient order.

    agent-recipient-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    R ← A

Examples:  
**me lole widu.** - _I them see._  
**te pang beku.** - _You bread bake._

#### 6.3.3. Order U3: Verb, agent and recipient

The verb-agent-recipient order is very rare but possible.
It is described here only for the sake of completeness.

    verb-agent-recipient
    
      V
       ↘
    R ← A

### 6.4. Summary of word orders

In theory there are six possible word orders for transitive verbs.
In practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia.
They are made possible by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the agent and the recipient.

Different orders put the focus on different constituents: the agent, the recipient or the verb.
The focus or emphasis is on the first constituent in the sentence.

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - recipient–agent–verb : musike me auda.
        - agent–verb–recipient :        me auda musike.
        - verb–recipient–agent :           auda musike me.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - agent-recipient-verb : me musike audu.
        - recipient-verb-agent :    musike audu me.
        - verb-agent-recipient :           audu me musike.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out.
So for example **musike me auda** can be truncated to **me auda**.
Likewise **me musike audu** can be truncated to **musike audu**.
Then it is possible to say something about either the agent or the recipient only.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Sentences

### 7.1. Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type.
They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention.

**maw!**
– A cat!  
**barxa!**
– (It) rains!

### 7.2. Stative Sentences

#### 7.2.1. With noun or pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.
In the simplest sentences, the subject is a noun or a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

**me bon.**
– I am good.  
**le nowi.**
– It is new.  
**le sarah.**
– She is Sarah.  
**sarah bon.**
– Sarah is good.  
**petre day.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze nowi.**
– The table is new.  

The word **ni** is added to form the negative.

**me ni bon.**
– I'm not good.  
**le ni nowi.**
– It's not new.  
**le ni sarah.**
– She is not Sarah.

It is possible to add the word **si** (yes) before the predicate in positive sentences,
for style or for convenience.
Then the structure is similar like in negative sentences.

**sarah si bon.**
– Sarah is good.  
**petre si day.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze si nowi.**
– The table is new.  
**meze ni law.**
– The table is not old.

Also two personal pronouns can be combined with **si** and **ni**.

**me si le.**
– I am he/she.  
**me ni te.**
– I'm not you.

#### 7.2.2. With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

**jowan si sundar.**
– Young is beautiful.  
**nowi ni purani.**
– New is not old.  

#### 7.2.3. With verb subject

A verb can't be subject as such.
So the verb is first, use **ce** to start a comment about the verb.

**canta, ce bon.**
– Singing, that is good. (Singing is good.)

#### 7.2.4. To be

Pandunia doesn't use a verb like "to be" in English.


### 7.3. Active Sentences

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb (i.e. an action-word).
In Pandunia, verbs are easy to identify because all of them end in **-a** or **-u**.

In Pandunia, two word orders are commonly used in active sentences:
subject-verb-object (SVO) and subject-object-verb (SOV).
A subject can be the agent or the recipient of the action.

The following sentences are in SVO order.

**me niama aple.**
– I eat apples.  
**me wida te.**
– I see you.  
**me suku musike.**
– I like music.

The following sentences are in SOV order.
They can't be translated word-by-word into English becaues English doesn't really support the SOV word order.

**me aple niamu.**
– _I apples eat._  
**me te widu.**
– _I at you look._

Pandunia supports both SVO and SOV word orders.
The are the most common word orders in the languages of the world.
SOV is used in many languages, including Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, Turkish, Japanese and Korean.
SVO is used in English, French, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Indonesian and Modern Arabic among others.


### 7.4. Passive Sentences

In the passive voice the focus of the sentence is on a subject
that is a passive recipient that undergoes the action.
So the recipient is the subject of the sentence.
Often the agent is not mentioned at all.

Normally the passive is expressed with the verb ending in **-u** and the recipient-verb word order.

**te widu.**
– You are seen.  
**musike audu.**
– Music is heard.  
**pang beku.**
– Bread is baked.  
**kupe kaputu.**
– Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with or without the preposition **da**.

**te widu me.** - You are seen by me.  
**te widu da me.** - You are seen by me.


### 7.6. Pivot structure

#### 7.6.1. Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 functions has dual role.
It is at the same time the object for verb 1 and the subject for verb 2.

**me wanta te niama sabze.**
– I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **me wanta** has **te** as its object.
At the same time, **te** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **niama sabze**.
So **te** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.

### 7.7. Serial verbs

There can be two, three or even more verbs in a series,
and all of them are about the same subject
 
1. **me gowa dom.**
   – I go home.  
2. **me abla gowa dom.**
   – I can go home.  
3. **me wanta abla gowa dom.**
   – I want to be able to go home.
   (Word for word: _I want can go home_!)

### 7.8. Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity.
This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### 7.8.1. Short pivot structure (VOVO)

**me eska te baxa pandunia.**
– I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
**eska te baxa pandunia?**
– Do you speak Pandunia.

#### 7.8.2. Short pivot structure (VVO)

**me plisa te laya dom.**
– I ask you to come home.  
**plisa laya dom!**
– Please come home!
(Word for word: _Request come home!_)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Conjunctions

### 8.1. Basic conjunctions

1. **i** and (connects two similar words or phrases)
2. **u** or (connects two alternative words or phrases)
3. **a** - but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or
   contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

**me suku maw i waf.**
– I like cats and dogs.  
**me suku maw u waf.**
– I like cats or dogs.  
**me suku maw a ni waf.**
– I like cats but not dogs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Particles

### 9.1. Affirmation and Negation

### 9.1.1. Affirmative

Particle **si** is affirmative and **ni** is negative.
**si** affirms the existence of something, whereas **ni** denies it.
In other words **si** means "to be" or "there is" and **ni** means "not to be" or "there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **si** is not always necessary.
However it is especially convenient in expressions of state.

**me si ren.**
– I am a person.  
**le si nowi meze.**
– It is a new table.

### 9.1.2. Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **ni**.

**me ni ren.**
– I'm not a person.  
**le ni nowi meze.**
– It's not a new table.

The word **ni** is used for denying anything.
It affects always the next word.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the negative word.

**me wida te.**
– I see you.  
**me ni wida te.**
– I don't see you.  
**me wida ni te a lole.**
– I see, not you, but them.

**me plisa te safa kamar.**
– I ask you to clean the room.  
**me ni plisa te safa kamar.**
– I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**me plisa te ni safa kamar.**
– I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The particles **si** and **ni** are used also for answering questions.

**eska te wida me?**
– Do you see me?  
**si. (me si wida te.)**
– Yes. (I do see you.)  
**ni. (me ni wida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that **si** and **ni** apply to the verb, not the whole question.

**eska te ni wida me?**
– Don't you see me?  
**si. (me si wida te.)**
– Yes. (I do see you.)  
**ni. (me ni wida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)

### 9.2. Modifier particles

Particles **du** and **da** are used to mark possession and modification.
**du** connects the modifying word or phrase to the modified word.
**da** works in the opposite direction.
It connects the modified word to the modifier.

#### 9.2.1. Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **du** works like the apostrophe-s ('s) in English.

**maria du mame**
– Maria's mother  
**me du dom**
– my house  
**me du pape du dom**
– my father's house

**da** works like "of" in English.

**mame da maria**
– the mother of Maria  
**dom da me**
– the house of mine  
**dom da pape da me**
– the house of the father of mine

#### 9.2.2. Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun.
It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

**roze rang du labe**
– rose-colored lips  
**saman rang du yen**
– sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

**labe da roze rang**
– lips of the color of the rose  
**yen da saman rang**
– eyes of the color of the sky

The particles help in creating measure words too.
 
**un sake du patate**
– one sack of potatos  
**dul sake du patate**
– two sacks of potatos  
**max sake du patate**
– more sacks of potatos
 
Note that **du** and **da** connect phrases together.
So a modifier phrase with and without **du** can mean a different thing.

**max sundar pul**
– more beautiful flowers  
**max du sundar pul**
– more of beautiful flowers

#### 9.2.3. Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particles.

**le si man da me wida.**
– He is the man that I saw.

Although **da** seems to have a similar role here as English relative pronouns
_which_, _that_, _who_ and _whom_, it's still nothing more than a particle
connecting a modifier (a verb phrase) to a modified. It's inseparable from the
modified noun, and does not have a back-referring relation to it. Instead, the
main-clause noun is implied within the relative clause right after the particle.

With **du**, it's possible to construct relative clauses that precede the
modified noun. (The main-clause noun is implied right before the particle.)

**buke dugu du ren sa kamar.**
– The book-reading person is in the room.  
**le duga du buke sa meze.**
– The book, that he/she reads, is on the table.

The modified noun can be part of an adpositional phrase too.

**me safara pa du site si teli.**
– My destination city is far away.

With the modified noun at the beginning, we need to call into action the
otherwise rarely used postpositions **nu**, **yu**, **su**, and **pu**.

**site da pu me safara si teli.**
– The city I’m traveling to is far away.  
**ci kalam da su me zay kitaba si nowi.**
– This pen, with which I’m writing now, is new.

### 9.3. Modal Particles

Modal particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener.
Modal particles are commonly used in many languages.
East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a modal particle modifies the subsequent word, or the whole sentence,
when the modal particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

**le niama bir plus.**
– S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
**le niama plus bir.**
– S/he drinks _also beer_.  
**le plus niama bir.**
– S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
**plus le niama bir.**
– _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Modal particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.

### 9.4. Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed.
The general time words are **pas** (past), **zay** (present) and **wil** (future, upcoming).
They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb.

**me pas tena maw.**
– I had cats.  
**a me ni zay tena maw.**
– But I now don't have cats.  
**abli me wil tena maw.**
– Maybe I will have cats.

It's also possible to say it in a longer way like **sa pase** (in the past) etc.

**me tena maw sa pase.**
– I had cats in the past.  
**a me ni tena maw sa zaye.**
– But I don't have cats at present.  
**munkin me tena maw sa wile.**
– Maybe I will have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated.
So the verb **tena** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary.
Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text
and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.

## 10. Prepositions

### 10.1. Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **sa** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in,
   on, by, during, while
2. **na** - absence or lack: without
3. **ya** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **pa** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

**me sa hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
**me sona sa hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
**me sona ya xam pa sube.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
**me safara du london pa paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

**me denga ya te gowa.** - I have waited since you left.  
**me denga pa te laya dom.** - I wait until you come home.  
**me denga sa te sona.** - I wait while you sleep.  

#### 10.1.2. sa

**sa** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**me libu sa dom.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**me loga sa pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**me loga sa doste sa pandunia sa fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia in telephone.

#### 10.1.3. Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

**me kata pang.** - I cut bread.  
**me kata pang, uza caku.** - I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

**me denga dura dul hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

**bada** - to follow; after, behind  
**dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
**jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
**loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
**sirka** - to surround; around  
**supra** - to surpass; over, above  

#### 10.1.4. Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

**me laya dom.** - I come home.  
**te sida kurse.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
**le lala sofa'.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
**fix nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
**jenger marca daw.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

### 10.2. Preposition of relation

Preposition **ka** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to
English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

**me jana pandunia ka gur.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**ka** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In
the above example **jana** (know) is the verb and **gur** (master) is
the point of comparison.

**ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

**bace si min day ka pape.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
**law pape si sam day ka pape.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**ka** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min**
(less) and **sam** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is
**pape** (father) in the examples above.



## 11. Word Building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia. Pandunia has a
productive system of word derivation. Most of the suffixes that are
used in Pandunia are already in international use. Many of hem come
from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

### 11.1. Part of speech markers

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation. In this system
the final vowel of a word marks the type of the word. The system
applies mainly to those words, which are derived from action-roots and
description-roots. Some adjectives are also derived from thing-roots.
Pronouns, conjuctions, numerals and particles are outside of the word
derivation system.

Pandunia uses the following vowel endings to mark parts of speech.

- **a** marks verbs for subject-verb-object word order (SVO)
- **u** marks verbs for object-verb-subject word order (OVS)
- **i** marks adjectives i.e. modifiers of nouns
- **e** marks nouns that are derived from action roots and description roots

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of
word from another. An ending is simply changed to another ending. Here
are some examples.

**loga** - to speak (active verb)  
**logu** - to be spoken (passive verb)  
**logi** - spoken, wordy (adjective)  
**loge** - speech, word(s) (noun)  

**kitaba** - to write (active verb)  
**kitabu** - to be written (passive verb)  
**kitabi** - written, textual (adjective)  
**kitabe** - writing, text (noun)  

**nowi** - new (adjective)  
**nowa** - to make new (active verb)  
**nowu** - to become new (passive verb)  
**nowe** - novelty, new thing (noun)  

There is a handful of verbs, which appear without the ending. These
are some of the most common verbs in Pandunia.

**wanta** - to want (active verb)  
**abla** - can, to be able to (active verb)  

#### 11.1.2. Deriving verbs

Dynamic verbs end in **-a** and **-u**. From the narrow perspective of
a phrase that consists of only a subject and a verb, it can be said
that **-a** marks an active verb and **-u** marks a passive verb. So
**loga** means _to speak_ and **logu** means _to be spoken_.

1. If the root is an action, then its verb form will mean "to do the
   action".  For example from **wide** = "a look" we get **wida** =
   "to look".
2. If the root is a description, like **now-** (**nowi** = new), then
   its verb form will mean "to turn into that quality". For example
   from **nowi** = "new" we get **nowa** = "to make new" or "to
   renew".
3. If the root is a thing, then its verb form will mean "to apply it
   to". For example from **hamar** = "hammer" we get **hamara** = "to
   hammer".


#### 11.1.3. Deriving nouns

**-e** is the marker of nouns. It means the result of the process. So
**loge** means the _speech_ that results from the act of speaking.

If the root word is an action, then its noun form will mean the
product of the action. For example from **kitab-** = "to write" we get
**kitabe** = "writing" or "text".

If the root word is a description, then its noun form will mean a
concrete instance of that quality. For example from **now-** = "new"
we get **nowe** = "a novelty" i.e. something new.

Additional noun suffixes are presented below.

#### 11.1.4. Deriving modifiers

**-i** is the marker of adjective and adjectival verb (i.e. static
verb). It is the all-purpose adjective suffix.

For example, from the verb **loga** (to speak) we get the adjective
**logi** (spoken, wordy). From the noun **insan** (human being), we
get the adjective **insani** (human, having the attributes of a human
being). However, only derived adjectives need to end in **-i**.

Words that are adjectives _by birth_ don't need the ending. That's why
for example **bon** (good) and **sundar** (beautiful) don't end in -i.

If the root word is a description, then its adjectival form will mean
"that which is in the state of the root". For example from **now-** =
quality of novelty, we get **nowi** = _new_ i.e. _that which is new_.

If the root is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state
that is produced by the action. For example from **loga** = "to speak"
we get **logi** = "spoken".

If the root is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival
form will mean "that which is like the root".

If the root is a place word, then its adjectival form will mean "that
which is from that place".

**iran** Iran, **irani** Iranian  
**pakistan** Pakistan, **pakistani** Pakistani  
**amerike** America, **ameriki** American  
**europe** Europe, **europi** European  
**asia** Asia, **asi** Asian

#### 11.1.5. Words without an ending

Nouns and modifiers don't always have the corresponding ending. For
example we normally use short word **insan** (human being) instead of
**insane**. Likewise we normally say **bon** (good) instead of
**boni**.

Also the complete word forms are accepted but they are not required.

Verbs however always have their proper endings. So we always say for
example **baxa** and **baxu** and never **bax** (as a verb). Instead,
**bax** is a noun i.e. short form of **baxe**.

### 11.2. Compound words

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a _compound word_. The
last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words
that come before it only modify its meaning.

Compound words are created by putting two words together and by
inserting the linking vowel **-o-** between them (in place of the
original word class marker).

Example: Creating **termometer** from **terme** and **meter**.  
First the word class marker **-e** is removed from **terme**,
leaving **term**. Then the linking vowel **-o-** is added and
then the second word **meter**, resulting into **term-o-meter** i.e.
**termometer**.

         terme      (temperature)  
       + meter      (measuring device)
    ____________
    = termometer    (thermometer)

The linking vowel -o- is not used when the second word begins with a
vowel. (So there is the so called _null morpheme_ -∅- instead.)

          dew       (god)  
       + iste       (proponent, -ist)
    ____________
    =  dewiste      (theist)


### 11.3. Common Suffixes

#### 11.3.1. -bli

Indicates possibility. It is attached after the verb root.

**widabli** which can be seen, visible

## 12. Advanced Topics

Note: You can learn the language without reading this chapter. But if
you're interested in the inner workings of the language, it can be
interesting to you.

### 12.1. Relations between the endings

A root is an idea that has many faces: a thing, a state and an action.

- The ending -e converts the idea into a thing.
  For example **nile** means blue color.
- The ending -i converts the idea into a description. The resulting
  modifier describes another idea with the modifying idea.
  For example **nili dom** means a blue house.
- The ending -a converts the idea into an action. The resulting verb
  is about applying the idea to an object.
  For example **nila dom** means _to apply blue on the house_ i.e.
  _to make the house blue_.
- The ending -u creates an action just like -a. The only difference
  is that the word order is different.

All endings can be applied on all ideas in the same way.

Here are a few examples of different types of ideas.

- concrete action
    - **kitabe** a writing
    - **kitabi** written, textual
    - **kitaba** to write
- abstract action
    - **fikre** a thought
    - **fikri** thinking
    - **fikra** to think
- description
    - **longe** length
    - **longi** long
    - **longa** to make long, to lengthen
- tool
    - **hamar** a hammer
    - **hamari** "hammery", hammerlike
    - **hamara** to hammer, to apply hammer on sth


### 12.2. Function Words

_Function words_ are words that help to organize words into more or less complex sentences.
It is a closed class i.e. new words are never or only very seldom be added to it.
Function words behave by definition differently than _content words_,
which is the open class for words that refer to things in the world outside the structure of the language.

In Pandunia, function words have the following characteristics:

1. The word is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
2. The consonant indicates the general idea of the word.
3. The vowel has a structural meaning, as follows:
    - **-e** indicates a pronoun
    - **-i** indicates a determiner or a modifier
    - **-a** indicates a preposition
    - **-u** indicates a postposition

|  | Idea                   | -a (preposition)       | -e (noun or pronoun)   | -i (modifier)          | -u (postposition)      |

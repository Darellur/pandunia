Pandunia, like Spanish, is pronounced exactly as it is spelt. No letter is
silent. Every letter has one sound, always the same.

## Vowel Sounds

Pandunia has five vowels.

    i   u
    e   o
      a

They are pronounced as follows: **a** like in _palm_, **e** like in _hey_, **i** like in _machine_, **o** like in _boy_ and **u** like in _rude_. They are pure vowels, so their quality doesn't change over the duration of the vowel.

Semivowels **y** and **w** are pronounced like in English.

## Consonant Sounds

    p  b  f     m  w
    t  d  s  z  n  l  r
    c  j  x        y
    k  g  h

Most consonants are pronounced same as in English. So the pronunciation of **b,
d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, t, w, z** is familiar and easy.

The following consonants are pronounced differently in Pandunia than in English.

- **g** is always hard like in _girl, get_.
- **r** is preferably trilled like in Scottish English or the rr in Spanish
  _carro_. Also other pronunciations are acceptable, including the standard
  English /ɹ/. Note that **r** is never silent!
- **s** is always voiceless like in _sissy_. **z** is voiced like in _zoo_.
- **x** is always pronounced like SH in _ship_.
- **c** is pronounced like CH in _chip_.
- **j** is pronounced like the English J.
- **n** is pronounced with the tip of the tongue except in combinations **nk**
  and **ng**, where it is velar /ŋ/ like in _banker_ and _finger_. In the end
  of a word, the **g** in **ng** can be silent. So the word **pang** can be
  pronounced /paŋ/ as well as /paŋg/.

## Stress Accent

The stressed syllable is before the last consonant.

1. Words with only one syllable carry the stress. Ex. máw, cíng.
2. The stress is on the last syllable in words that end with a consonant. Ex.
   komún, bazár, kamís.
3. The stress is on the second last syllable in words that end with a vowel.
   Ex. nówi, dúnia, musíke.

     dunia si mimen da sundar planete.
    /dúnia sí mimén da sundár planéte./

     mi wol loga komun baxa, ye si pandunia.
    /mí wól lóga komún báxa, yé sí pandúnia./

If the stressed syllable is other than stated in the rules above, it is marked
with the acute accent mark (´).

     darse gurú suku kafé.
    /dárse gurú súku kafé./

## Letter Case

Pandunia is normally written only in small letters (i.e. lower case letters).
Capital letters can be in the beginning of sentences and proper nouns, such as
personal names and place names, but it is not required.

There are three reasons why capital letters are not necessary.

1. Writing represents speech and there are no "capital sounds" in speech in
   beginning of proper names etc.
2. Most of the scripts and alphabets of the world have only one letter case.
3. It is simpler to use only small letters.

Note! It's not a mistake to use the capital letters. Sometimes people do it
because they are used to them in other languages. But still capital letters are
unnecessary and not recommended.

Capital letters are used in standard international acronyms. For example: 10 Mb
(des mega bit), 100 Gb (hon giga bit), 2 mm (du mili metre), 1 kJ (un kilo
jul).

## Syllabification

[-] Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen. The hyphen is placed
between spoken syllables. For example: bin, ka-fé, yu-mor, pos-ta.

## Punctuation

[.] All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

[?] Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

[!] Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

[...] Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) may be used to indicate incomplete sentence or
uncertainty.

[:] Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation or a list.

[,] Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

In informal texts smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used to indicate mood.
For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

> **mi wida tu :)** = I see you.  
> **mi no wida tu :(** = I don't see you.

# Word building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia.
Pandunia has a productive system of word derivation.
Most of the suffixes that are used in Pandunia are already in international use.
Many of them come from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

## Word class markers

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation.
In this system the final vowel of a word indicates its word class.
So the stem of the word indicates a general idea
and the vowel endings indicate different manifestations of that idea:
a thing (noun), a description (modifier) and an action (verb).

Pandunia uses the following vowel endings to mark parts of speech.

- **-e** marks nouns that are derived from action roots and description roots
- **-i** indicates adjectives
- **-o** indicates adverbs
- **-a** indicates active verbs
- **-u** indicates passive verbs

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another.
An ending is simply changed to another ending.

- The ending -e converts the idea into a thing.
  For example **nile** means blue color.
- The ending -i converts the idea into a description.
  The resulting modifier describes another idea with the modifying idea.
  For example **nili dome** means a blue house.
- The ending -a converts the idea into an action.
  The resulting verb is about applying the idea to an object.
  For example **nila dome** means _to apply blue on the house_ i.e. _to make the house blue_.
- The ending -u creates an action just like -a.
  The only difference is that the word order is reversed.

All endings can be applied on all ideas in the same way.

Here are a few examples of different types of ideas.

- concrete action
    - **kitabe** a writing (noun)
    - **kitabi** written, textual (modifier)
    - **kitaba** to write (active verb)
	- **kitabu** to be written (passive verb)
- abstract action
    - **fikre** a thought (noun)
    - **fikri** thinking (modifier)
    - **fikra** to think (active verb)
	- **fikru** to be thought (passive verb)
- description
    - **longe** length (noun)
    - **longi** long (modifier)
    - **longa** to make long, to lengthen (active verb)
	- **longu** to get long (passive verb)
- tool
    - **hamar** a hammer (noun)
    - **hamari** "hammery", hammerlike (modifier)
    - **hamara** to hammer, to apply hammer on sth (active verb)
	- **hamaru** to be hammered (passive verb)


### Deriving verbs

**-a** and **-u** are the endings for verbs.

1. If the stem's idea is an action, then its verb form will mean "to do the action".
   For example from **vide** (_a look_) we get **vida** (_to look_).
2. If the idea is a description then its verb form will mean "to turn into that quality".
   For example from **novi** (_new_) we get **nova** (_to make new_ or _to renew_).
3. If the idea is a thing, then its verb form will mean "to apply it to".
   For example from **hamar** (_hammer_) we get **hamara** (_to hammer_).


### Deriving nouns

**-e** is the ending for nouns.

If the stem's idea is an action, then its noun form will mean the result or the product of the action.
For example from **kitaba** (_to write_) we get **kitabe** (_writing_ or _text_).


If the idea is a description, then its noun form will mean a concrete instance of that quality.
For example from **novi** (_new_) we get **nove** (_a novelty_ i.e. something new).

Additional noun suffixes are presented below.

### Deriving adjectives

**-i** is the ending for adjectives and adjectival verbs.

If the stem's idea is a description, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is in the state of the root".
For example from **nov-** (_newness_), we get **novi** (_new_ i.e. _that which is new_).

If the idea is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state that is produced by the action.
For example from **loga** (_to speak_) we get **logi** (_spoken_).

If the idea is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is like the root".
For example, from the noun **insan** (_human being_), we get the adjective **insani** (_human_, having the attributes of a human being).

If the root is a place word, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is from that place".

**irania** Iran, **irani** Iranian  
**pakistan** Pakistan, **pakistani** Pakistani  
**amerike** America, **ameriki** American  
**europe** Europe, **europi** European  
**asia** Asia, **asi** Asian

### Words without an ending

Some words in Pandunia don't have a vowel ending.
These are the rules:

- Verbs always have an ending: **-a** or **-u**.
- Modifiers almost always have the ending **-i**.
  The most common adjectives are exceptions to the rule: **bon, mal, lil, day**.
- Nouns almost always have the ending **-e** or **-ia**.
  Some common nouns and suffixes are exceptions to the rule (ex. **cay, maw, hotel, kitaber, helium**).

For example we normally use short word **insan** (_human being_) instead of **insane**.
Likewise we normally say **bon** (_good_) instead of **boni**.
Note that it is always acceptable to use the vowel endings on every word.
It is an artistic choice by the authors of Pandunia to not require them on these words.


## Compound words

Two or more words can be put together to make a _compound word_.
The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound
and the words that come before it only modify its meaning.

Compound words are made of bare word stems,
which are joined together by the linking vowel **-o-**.

For example, this is how **kanosuy** (_tears_) is made:

          kan       (eye)
       +  suy       (water)
    ____________
    = kanosuy       (eyewater, tear)

And this is how **termometer** (_thermometer_) is made:

         terme      (temperature)  
       + meter      (measuring device)
    ____________
    = termometer    (thermometer)

The linking vowel **-o-** is not used when the second word begins with a vowel.

          dew       (god)  
       + iste       (proponent, -ist)
    ____________
    =  dewiste      (theist)

The ending vowel of the first word is always dropped when a compound word is made.

         pace       (peace)
       + iste       (proponent, -ist)
    ____________
    =  paciste      (proponent of peace, pacifist)

### Function Words

_Function words_ are words that help to organize words into more or less complex sentences.
It is a closed class i.e. new words are never or only very seldom be added to it.
Function words behave by definition differently than _content words_,
which is the open class for words that refer to things in the world outside the structure of the language.

In Pandunia, function words have the following characteristics:

1. The word is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
2. The consonant indicates the general idea of the word.
3. The vowel has a structural meaning, as follows:
    - **-e** indicates a pronoun
    - **-i** indicates a determiner or a modifier
    - **-a** indicates a preposition
    - **-u** indicates a postposition

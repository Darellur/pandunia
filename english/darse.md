Introducing yourself
--------------------

### Dialog

> ☻: **tu si ke?** = Who are you?  
> ☺: **mi si yusef. tu si ke?** = I am Yusef. Who are you?  
> ☻: **mi si maria. ye si ke?** = I am Maria. Who is that?  
> ☺: **ye si mi da panyo.** = That is my friend.  
> ☻: **ye da nam si ke?** = What's her name?  
> ☺: **ye da nam si sara.** = Her name is Sara.

### Grammar

Pandunia's sentences normally follow the topic-comment structure. The topic indicates who or what is being talked about. The comment tells something about the topic. For instance in **ye si mi da panyo** the topic is the pronoun **ye** (he, she, it), which is followed by the comment **si mi da panyo** (is my friend).

The word **si** means _to be_ in Pandunia. The same word is used for all persons. And to say the opposite, simply replace it with **no** (which is the word for _no_).

> **ye si sara.** - She is Sara.  
> **ye no sara.** - She is not Sara.  

> **mau si hewan** - The cat is an animal.  
> **mau no hewan** - The cat is not an animal.

Saying hello
------------

> **salam** = Hello!

This is how people greet each other in Pandunia. They say **salam**. It is used for saying both hello and goodbye.

> **salam** = Bye!

The word **salam** means "greeting". It is originally an Arabic word, which means _peace_, and it is a common greeting in many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia. Pandunia is a constructed world language, which borrows words from all parts of the world.

**salam** is also a verb, which means "to greet".

> **mi salam tu.** = I greet you.  
> **tu salam mi.** = You greet me.

These are active sentences. In active sentences the subject does the action to the object. In **mi salam tu** the first word, **mi**, is the subject, **salam** is the verb (action word), and **tu** is the object. The order of subject, verb and object is important and it never changes.

> Word order in active sentence: Subject + Verb + Object

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and **ye** = he, she, it. Note that the pronouns stayed the same in the previous example sentences. Words never change in Pandunia. They always stay the same regardless of their position in sentence.

In Pandunia sentences can be made shorter by leaving out pronouns that are obvious in the present situation.

> **mi salam tu!** = I greet you.  
> **salam tu!** = Greetings to you! (It is obvious that the speaker is the one who greets.)  
> **salam!** = Greetings! (It is obvious that the listeners are greeted.)

The pattern in **salam tu** is convenient for addressing people by name, kinship term or profession.

> **salam toni!** = Hello, Tony!  
> **salam mama!** = Hello, mother!  
> **salam papa!** = Hello, father!  
> **salam xefe!** = Hello, chief!

Another Pandunia word for greeting is **halo**. It is also a very international greeting. You can choose freely, which word to use when you greet people.

**halo!** - Hello!

Making requests
---------------

### Dialog

☻: **salam!** = Hello!  
☺: **salam! cing side.** = Hello! Please sit!  
☻: **danke.** = Thank you.  
☺: **cing nyam kafe u ca.** = Please have some coffee or tea.  
☻: **mi nyam ca. danke.** = I will have some tea, thank you.  
...
☺: **cing salam tu su mama!** = Please tell greetings to your mother.  
☻: **mi salam ye. salam!** = I will. Bye!  
☺: **salam!** = Bye!


### Grammar

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and **ye** = he, she, it. Pandunia is a gender-neutral language. It doesn't distinguish between sexes in the third person pronoun or any of the pronouns. All the personal pronouns are present in the following example sentence.

> **mi cing tu salam ye.** = I ask you to say hello to him/her.

This sentence has a _pivot structure_. The first verb, **cing** = to request, addresses **tu** as its object. At the same time **tu** serves also as the subject of the second verb, **salam** = to greet, whose object is **ye**. So **tu** has a double role: (1) object of the first verb and (2) subject of the second verb. Hence, it is the _pivot_ or hinge between the two verbs.

> Pivot Stucture: Subject + Verb¹ + Object/Subject + Verb² + Object

The pivot structure is a common structure in Pandunia.

Remember that it is allowed to leave out pronouns that are known in the context. In other words the speaker can safely assume that the listeners know who he or she is talking about. So it is unnecessary to keep on repeating them. In this manner phrases can be made shorter.

> **mi cing tu salam ye.** = I ask you to say hello to him/her.  
> **cing salam ye.** = Please say hello to him/her.

See how the translation of **cing** changed between the two sentences? The meaning of the word, the concept, did not change, but its use did. English reflects this change by using different words, to ask and please. Pandunia can cope with changes like this without resorting to different words. It is a principle in Pandunia that there is always exactly one word for one concept. Different words are not created just because the grammatical role of a concept changes.

The phrase **cing salam ye** has a useful pattern that can be used for making polite requests.

> **cing side.** = Please be seated.  
> **cing da kafe.** = Please give me some coffee.  
> **cing da ca.** = Please give me some tea.  
> **cing nyam ca.** = Please have some tea.

<!--
> **cing safi kamar.** = Please clean the room.

Commands are introduced with **koman** = to command. They employ the same pivot structure as requests with **cing**.

> **koman da ca.** = Give (me) some tea!  
> **koman safi kamar.** = Clean the room!

In practice, direct commands can be also made with just one verb and a commanding voice.

> **safi!** = Clean it!

Yes or no questions
-------------------

### Dialog

☻: **salam! kia tu nyam kafe u ca?** = Hello! Would you like to have coffee or tea?  
☺: **ca.** = Tea.  
☻: **i tu?** = And you?  
○: **mi no baxa pandunia...** = I don't speak Pandunia...  
☻: **sori! kia ye nyam ca?** = Pardon! Will he have tea?  
☺: **no. ye no nyam ca. ye nyam kafe.** = No, he won't. He would like to have coffee.  
☻: **kia tu nyam supa?** = Would you like to have soup?  
☺: **nyam.** = Yes. (_I eat._)  
☻: **kia ye nyam supa?** = Would he like to have soup?  
☺: **no nyam.** = No.  
☻: **danke. mi da un ca i un kafe i un supa na bada du des minut.**
 = Thank you. I will bring one tea, one coffee and one soup in ten minutes.


### Asking questions

Questions that can be answered by saying _yes_ or _no_ have the same pivot structure as requests with **cing**, which you learned in the previous lesson. Question sentences are introduced with **kia** = to ask.

> **mi kia tu nyam ca.** = I ask (do) you drink tea.  
> **kia tu nyam ca?** = Do you drink tea?  
> **kia nyam ca?** = Drink tea?

Requests usually concern the one or the ones spoken to, but questions are often about other people. Therefore the second pronoun is usually needed. It can be left out only when it is clear who is the topic of discussion.

> **kia ye nyam ca?** = Does he or she drink tea?  
> **kia tu nyam supa?** = Do you eat soup?  
> **kia mimen nyam su?** = Do we drink water?

Of course common and proper nouns can also be used.

> **kia xefe si nyam kafe?** = Does the chief drink coffee?  
> **kia papa si safi kamar?** = Does the father clean the room?  
> **kia niki si baxa pandunia?** = Does Nicky speak Pandunia?


### Giving answers

Yes/no questions can be answered with **si** = yes, and **no** = no.

> – **kia tu nyam supa?** = Do you eat soup?  
> – **si.** = Yes.  
> – **kia ye nyam supa?** = Does she eat soup?  
> – **no.** = No.

Also more complete answers can be given.

> – **kia tu nyam kafe?** = Do you drink coffee?  
> – **si. mi nyam kafe.** = Yes, I drink coffee.  
> – **kia ye nyam kafe?** = Does he drink coffee?  
> – **no. ye no nyam kafe.** = No, he doesn't drink coffee.

It is also possible to answer yes by repeating the main verb of the question.

> – **kia tu nyam sui?** = Do you drink water?  
> – **nyam.** = (Yes, I) drink.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saying no
---------

In the previous lesson you learned to answer **si** and **no** to questions. The word **no** is used for denying something. Adding **no** in front of the verb turns an affirmative sentence to negative.

> **mi salam tu.** = I greet you.  
> **mi no salam tu.** = I do not greet you.

Conceptually negation means the absence or non-existence of the negated word. In the phrase **mi no salam tu** the negative word **no** denies the existence of greeting. In Pandunia the negative word affects the word that follows it. Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the negative word.

> **mi cing tu safi kamar.** = I ask you to clean the room.  
> **mi no cing tu safi kamar.** = I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
> **mi cing tu no safi kamar.** = I ask you NOT to clean the room.


The negated word can be of any type: verb, pronoun, noun, adjective and even numeral.

> **ye no ha mau.** = She doesn't have a cat.  
> **ye ha no mau, a waf.** = She has no cats but dogs.  
> **no ye, a mi ha mau.** = Not she but I have cats.  
> **mi ha no un, a du mau.** = I have not one but two cats.

More Questions
--------------

To ask questions beginning with _what_, _which_, _how_, _who_ and _when_, the interrogative pronoun **ke** is normally used. The question can be made more specific by adding words for person, time, manner or thing if needed.

> **ye si ke?** = What is that? / Who is (s)he?  
> **ke ren lai?** = Who is coming? (**ren** = person)  
> **ke zaman tu nyam?** = When do you eat? (**zaman** = time)  
> **ke yang dansa?** = How to dance? (**yang** = manner, style)

In Pandunia, questions beginning with _why_ are asked using **koz ke**.

> **tu suku mau koz ke?** = Why do you like cats?

Questions asking about the cause or reason of something, are answered by adding **koz** before the cause or reason. **koz** is actually a passive verb meaning _to be caused by_.

> **tu suku mau koz ke?** = Why do you like cats?  
> **koz yemen kaway.** = Because they are cute.

Of course **koz** can also be used to express the cause or reason for something, even when not answering to a question.

> **mi suku mau koz yemen kaway** = I like cats because they are cute.

Past, present and future
------------------------

### Expressing time

There are no verb conjugations in Pandunia. All verbs have only one form. In a way they are similar to some English verbs, such as "to hit", which is the same in all tenses.

> **mi darba ye.** = I hit it.

In Pandunia all verbs are like that! For example, **mi nyam pan** can mean both "I eat bread" and "I ate bread", but usually only one or the other meaning makes sense in the context of the discussion. For example when people talk about that morning's breakfast, the sentence tells about the past time.

> **mi nyam pan na suba nyam.** = I ate bread for morning meal.

There are also specific time words.

> **ja** - already, prior to some time
> **gang** - just, recently
> **zai** - currently, at the moment
> **hai** - still
> **sun** - soon
> **futur** - in the future



The adjectives for past, present and future are **pas, nun** and **futur**. They can be used for modifying nouns.

> **sara si mi su pas xefe.** = Sara is my former boss.
> **yusef si mi su zai xefe.** = Yusef is my current boss.
> **maria si mi su futur xefe.** = Maria is my future boss.

The same words are used when you talk about actions and events in time. Simply put the word before the verb.

> **mi pas darba ye.** = I hit it (in the past).
> **mi zai darba ye.** = I am hitting it (currently).
> **mi futur darba ye.** = I will hit it (in the future).

Alternatively the time word can be placed last in the sentence.

> **mi darba ye pas.**
> **mi darba ye zai.**
> **mi darba ye futur.**


It is not necessary to repeat the time expressions all the time. It would be awkward. It is enough to set the stage once in the beginning with a time expression. Another time word will not be needed until the tense changes or until it becomes useful to stress that you are still talking in the same tense.

> **mi pas ha un mau.** = I had a cat in the past.
> **ye bon mau.** = It was a good cat.
> **mi ha un waf nun.** = I have a dog now.

Any expression of time is good for expressing the tense. When one time expression is present, other markers are not needed.

> **mi jenu na nen 2003.** = I was born in 2003.
> **ye safi kamar na bada den.** = He will clean the room tomorrow.


### Word List

**pas** past, former. **zai** present, current. **futur** future. **darba** to hit, to beat. **pan** bread. **suba nyam** morning meal, breakfast.

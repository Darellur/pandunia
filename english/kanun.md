Grammar
=======

## 0. Introduction

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in Pandunia. However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading this grammar, for example with the help of a phrasebook and a dictionary.

All language teachers know that a language becomes more difficult to learn when the student must learn to make distinctions that he is not used to making. That's why students have difficulties with things like irregular spelling, case-inflection, mandatory tenses, tones, noun/adjective agreement, honorific inflection, consonant and vowel harmony, mandatory gender distinctions and so on.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn. It doesn't have any of the previously mentioned complexities. Instead, it has a simple grammar, a relatively simple vocabulary, and a simple phonetic spelling.

One thing to keep in mind as you learn Pandunia is that it is not a strict, rule-oriented language where there is a "right way" and a "wrong way" to say things. The important thing is to make yourself understood. Consequently, much of the language involves the lexical items (words that have meaning, like "book" or "eat"), and very little involves purely grammatical ideas (like singular vs. plural and tenses).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Basic rules

These are the basic rules of Pandunia language.

1. All words are unchanging.
2. When a word or phrase is before another one, the former modifies the latter.
3. A pause or a determiner begins a new noun phrase.
4. The subject is joined to the predicate without using a copula i.e. without a "be".
5. In the pivot structure, the object of the first predicate functions as the subject of the next predicate.
6. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
7. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
8. The stress accent is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Nouns

### 2.1. Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

> **batu** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
> **meza** - a table, tables, the table or the tables  
> **kursi** - a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
> **sui** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the word **surya** refers to _the sun_ and **luna** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and our only moon.

### 2.2. Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in singular and plural.

The number can be mentioned with number words.

> **un batu** - one stone  
> **du batu** - two stones  
> **san batu** - three stones

If the number is not mentioned, there are different possibilities.

1. The number is not important.
2. The number is not known.
3. The number is already known. (It has been already been mentioned.)

> **kia tu ha baca?** - Do you have a child / children?

An easy way to emphasize plurality is to repeat the noun.

> **batu batu** - stones, lots of stones  
> **tara tara** - stars, lots of stars  

### 2.3. Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine and/or neuter categories).

Some words carry _natural gender_. For example **fem** (woman) is feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

> **mumu** - bovine  
> **man mumu** - bull  
> **fem mumu** - cow

### 2.4. Compounds

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

> **sol guang** - sunlight  
> **luna guang** - moonlight  
> **luna batu** - moonstone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to the thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.

### 3.1. Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun. In Pandunia an adjective is a modifier that is before a noun.

> **dai batu** - big stone
> **dai meza** - big table  
> **gau meza** - high table
> **bon kursi** - good chair

When adjective can be also after the noun. Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

> **batu dai.** - The stone is big.  
> **meza gau.** - The table is high.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

> **dai meza gau.** - Big table is high.


### 3.2 Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia an adverb is a modifier that is before a verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **mi _bon_ son.** - I well sleep.  
> **mi son _bon_.** - I sleep _well_.  
> **tu baxa pandunia _bon_.** - You speak Pandunia _well_.


### 3.4 Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier. For example **dai** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

> **dai ren** - big person  
> **lil ren** - little person  
> **sundar ren** - beautiful person

> **dai sundar ren** - very beautiful person  
> **lil sundar ren** - somewhat beautiful person

The modifiers can be separated by using **i** (and).

> **lil i sundar ren** - a little and beautiful person


### 3.5. Comparison

Modifiers can be compared.

- **max** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sam** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **ka** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of comparison.

> **mi si max bon ka tu.** - I am better than you.  
> **tu loga sam bon ka mi.** - You speak as well as mi.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Numerals

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about. For example, the word **surya** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

> **un tara** - one star  
> **du tara** - two stars  
> **san tara** - three stars  
> **poli tara** - several stars (two or more)  
> **xau tara** - few stars
> **multi tara** - many stars

> **un dai meza** - one big table  
> **du dai kursi** - two big chairs  
> **san bon kursi** - three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

> **fen un** - the first part (part one)
> **fen du** - the second part (part two)
> **fen san** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nul**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **du**
- 3 **san**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **ci**
- 8 **ba**
- 9 **noi**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another – exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nul** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un du**
- 13 **un san**
- 20 **du nul**
- 21 **du un**
- 22 **du du**
- 100 **un nul nul** or **hon**
- 101 **un nul un** or **hon un**
- 200 **du nul nul** or **du hon**


Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    


## 5. Pronouns

### 5.1. Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**mi** - I, mi  
**tu** - you  
**ye** - he, she, it  
**mimen** - we  
**tumen** - you all  
**yemen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi wide se** - I see myself.  
**ye wide se** - She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mimen wide se.** - We see ourselves.  


### 5.2. Demonstrative pronouns

**li** is the general demonstrative pronoun. It covers the meaning of both _this_ and _that_.

The distance to the speaker can be specified by adding words **jin** (near) and **tel** (far), if needed.

**li** - this or that  
**li jin** - this over here  
**li tel** - that over there  

The demonstrative pronouns work like modifiers.

> **li batu.** - That stone  
> **li si batu.** - That is a stone.  
> **li batu cung.** - That stone is heavy.  


### 5.3. Interrogative pronoun

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of English words _who, what_ and _which_.

> **ke?** - Who or what?  
> **ke xe?** - What? (Which thing?)  
> **ke ren?** - Who? (Which person?)  
> **ke zaman?** - When? (What time?)  
> **ke yang?** - How? (What manner?)  
> **ke koz?** - Why? (What cause?)  



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Sentences

### 8.1. Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type. They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention to it.

> **mau!** - A cat!  
> **pluva!** - (It) rains!  


### 7.2. Stative Sentences


#### 7.2.1. With pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In the simplest sentences, the subject is a personal pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

> **mi bon.** - I am good.  
> **ye nowa.** - It is new.  
> **ye sara.** - She is Sara.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

> **mi no bon.** - I'm not good.  
> **ye no nowa.** - It's not new.  
> **ye no sara.** - She is not Sara.

Also two personal pronouns can be juxtaposed.

> **mi si ye.** - I am he/she.  
> **mi no tu.** - I'm not you.

#### 7.2.2. With noun subject

When the subject is a noun, the word **si** (yes) is added before the predicate in positive sentences. The negative sentences use **no** like above.

> **sara si bon.** - Sara is good.  
> **batu si dai.** - The stone is big.  
> **meza si nowa.** - The table is new.  
> **meza no lau.** - The table is not old.


#### 7.2.3. With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

> **jowan si sundar.** - Young is beautiful.  
> **nowa no lau.** - New is not old.  

#### 7.2.4. To be

Pandunia doesn't use a verb like "to be" in English.



### 7.3. Active Sentences

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb (i.e. an action-word).

Active sentences usually have the subject–verb–object word order (SVO).

> **mi nyam pingo.** - I eat apples.  
> **mi audi musika.** - I hear music.  
> **mi wide tu.** - I see you.

The order can be changed easily to the object–subject–verb word order (OSV).

> **pingo mi nyam.** - Apples, I eat.  
> **musika mi audi.** - Music, I hear.  
> **tu mi wide.** - You, I see.



### 7.4. Passive Sentences

#### 7.4.1. OV order

In the passive voice there is no agent subject in the sentence. There is only the object and the verb.

> **tu wide.** - You are seen.  
> **musika audi.** - Music is heard.  
> **pan beka.** - Bread is baked.  

Here the focus is on the object, which is the first word in the sentence. The object is a passive actor that undergoes the action.

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with the preposition **de**.

> **tu wide de mi.** - You are seen by me.


#### 7.4.2. OV order

In verb–object (VO) order the focus is on the verb.

> **wide tu.** - Seeing you.  
> **audi musik.** - Listening music.  
> **beka pan.** - Baking bread.



### 7.6. Pivot structure

#### 7.6.1. Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 functions has dual role. It is at the same time the object for verb 1 and the subject for verb 2.

> **mi wol tu nyam sabzi.** - I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **mi wol** has **tu** as its object. At the same time, **tu** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **nyam sabzi**. So **tu** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.


### 7.7. Serial verbs

All action-words (verbs) that come one after another are activated by the subject. There can be two, three or even more action-words in series.
 
1. **mi go dom.** - I go home.  
2. **mi ken go dom.** - I can go home.  
3. **mi wol ken go dom.** - I want to be able to go home. (Lit. _I want can go home_!)


### 7.8. Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity. This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### 7.8.1. Short pivot structure (VOVO)

> **mi kia tu baxa pandunia.** - I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
> **kia tu baxa pandunia?** - Do you speak Pandunia.

#### 7.8.2. Short pivot structure (VVO)

> **mi cing tu lai jia.** - I ask you to come home.  
> **cing lai jia!** - Please come home! (Literally: _Request come home!_)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Conjunctions

### 8.1. Basic conjunctions

1. **i** and (connects two similar words or phrases)
2. **u** or (connects two alternative words or phrases)
3. **a** - but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

> **mi suka mau i waf.** - I like cats and dogs.  
> **mi suka mau u waf.** - I like cats or dogs.  
> **mi suka mau a no waf.** - I like cats but not dogs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Particles


### 9.1. Affirmation and Negation

### 9.1.1. Affirmative

Particle **si** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **si** affirms the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it. In other words **si** means "to be" or "there is" and **no** means "not to be" or "there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **si** is not always necessary. However it is especially convenient in expressions of state.

> **mi si ren.** - I am a person.  
> **ye si nowa meza.** - It is a new table.

### 9.1.2. Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

> **mi no ren.** - I'm not a person.  
> **ye no nowa meza.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

> **mi wide tu.** - I see you.  
> **mi no wide tu.** - I don't see you.  
> **mi wide no tu a yemen.** - I see, not you, but them.

The particles **si** and **no** are used also for answering questions.

> **kia tu wide mi?** - Do you see me?  
> **si. (mi wide tu.)** - Yes. (I see you.)  
> **no. (mi no wide tu.)** - No. (I don't see you.)



### Modifier particles

Particles **su** and **de** are used to mark possession and modification. **su** connects the modifying word or phrase to the modified word. **de** works in the opposite direction. It connects the modified word to the modifier.

#### 9.2.1. Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **su** works like apostrophe-s ('s) in English.

> **maria su mama** - Maria's mother  
> **mi su dom** - my house  
> **mi su papa su dom** - my father's house

**de** works like "of" in English.

> **mama de maria** - the mother of Maria
> **dom de mi** - the house of mine  
> **dom de papa de mi** - the house of the father of mine

#### 9.2.2. Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

> **roza rang su labi** - rose-colored lips  
> **sama rang su yen** - sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

> **labi de roza rang** - lips of the color of the rose  
> **yen de sama rang** - eyes of the color of the sky

#### 9.2.3. Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particles.

Here **de** has a similar role as English relative pronouns _which_, _that_, _who_ and _whom_.

> **ye si man _de mi wide_.** - He is the man _that I saw_.

If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (i.e. if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause.

> **mi wide man _de nyam pingo_.** - I see a man _who eats apples_.  

It's possible to construct relative clauses with **su** too. Then the relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. The verb is turned into a modifier by putting **su** immediately after the verb.

> **mi wide _pingo nyam su_ man.** - I see an _apple-eating_ man.



### 9.3. Modal Particles

Modal particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener. Modal particles are commonly used in many languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a modal particle modifies the subsequent word, or the whole sentence, when the modal particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

> **ye nyam bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
> **ye nyam plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
> **ye plus nyam bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
> **plus ye nyam bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Modal particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.


### 9.4. Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed. The general time words are **pas** (past), **zai** (present) and **futur** (future). They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **mi ha mau pas.** - I had cats in the past.
> **a mi no ha mau zai.** - But I don't have cats now.
> **munkin mi ha mau futur.** - Maybe I have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated. So the verb **ha** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Prepositions

### 10.1. Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **na** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in, on, by, during, while
2. **be** - absence or lack: without
3. **ze** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **do** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

> **mi na hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
> **mi son na hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
> **mi son ze xam do suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
> **mi safar ze london do paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  


Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

> **mi lai jia.** - I come home.  
> **tu side kursi.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
> **ye lala sofa.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
> **jang ja marce dau.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

#### 10.1.2. na

**na** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**mi stasa na dom.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**mi loga na pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**mi loga na panyo na pandunia na fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia in telephone.


#### 10.1.3. Preposition with a verb

Pandunia prepositions have very broad meaning. More precise meanings can be obtained by attaching a verb phrase immediately after the preposition.

> **mi kata pan.** - I cut bread.  
> **mi kata pan na caku.** - I cut bread with a knife.  
> **mi kata pan na uza caku.** - I cut bread _by using_ a knife.

> **mi deng.** - I wait  
> **mi deng na du hor.** - I wait for two hours.  
> **mi deng na dura do hor.** - I wait _during_ two hours.

Many of these expressions are very useful.

- before  
**na bada** - after, following  
**na dura** - during  
**na tema** - about (a topic)  

**na pice de** - at the back of  
**na pice** - behind  

**ye lai na pice mi.** - He comes behind me.  
**ye lai na bada mi.** - He comes after me.  



Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they refer to time.

> **mi deng ze tu go.** - I have waited since you left.  
> **mi deng do tu lai jia.** - I wait until you come home.  
> **mi deng na tu son.** - I wait while you sleep.  

More precise expressions of place and time are expressed with _a preposition + a place word + **du**_.

> **na dura de** - for the time/duration of  
> **mi deng na dura de tu son.** - I wait for the time when you sleep.  
> **na loka de** - at the place of  
> **mi deng na loka de tu go.** - I wait at the place where you left.  
> **na xia de** - under, below  
> **un waf lala na xia de meza.** - A dog lies under the table.  
> **na fas de** - on the surface of  
> **un mau lala na fas de meza.** - A cat lies on the table.

Similar meaning can be expressed also with compound words.

> **un mau lala na meza fas.** - A cat lies at the tabletop.

### 10.2. Preposition of relation

Prepositions **ka** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

> **mi sabi pandunia ka guru.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**ka** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In the above example **sabi** (know) is the verb and **guru** (master) is the point of comparison.

**ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

> **ban si min dai ka papa.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
> **opa si sam dai ka papa.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**ka** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min** (less) and **sem** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is **papa** (father) in the examples above.




### 10.3. List of compound prepositions

**na ante** before. **na bada** after.  
**na cen** in front. **na pice** behind.  
**na xia** under, below. **na gau** over, above.  
**na jin** near. **na far** far away. **na visin** beside, next to.





## 12. Advanced Topics

### 12.1. Hierarchy of Word Types

Spoken language is a flow of sounds which constitute words. Written language, in the case of Pandunia, is a flow of letters from left to right, which constitute words. So every expression is essentially a sequence of words. However all words are not equal. There is a hierarchy of words. The verb is the structural center of a sentence and other words are directly or indirectly connected to it.

Each sentence can be drawn as a tree diagram, where the central words are above and the dependant words are below. For example the sentence **mi wida tu** (I see you) can be pictured as a tree as follows.

    mi wide tu.

       wide
      ┌─┴─┐
     mi   tu

Adjectives and numerals point to their head word, the noun.

    mi wide san jowan ren.

       wide
      ┌─┴──┐
     mi   ren
           |
         jowan
           |
          san

The hierarchy of word types in Pandunia from the more to the less central is as follows.

1. Conjunctions: i, u, a
2. Connectors: su, de
3. Prepositions: na, be, do, ze
4. Verbs
5. Nouns and pronouns
6. Tense, aspect and mood particles
7. Numerals
8. Adjectives

The following example shows how the scope affects the final position of words in the tree hierarchy. For example, although **i** is in general higher than **koz**, here its scope is only to connect **yusef** and **sara**. **Ze koz du** is at the top, because it connects the two sub-phrases.


    yusef i sara wol darsa pandunia ze koz da ye si bon dunia baxa.

                      ze koz da
               ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              wol                   si
          ┌────┴──────┐           ┌──┴──┐
          i         darsa        ye    baxa
      ┌───┴───┐    ┌──┴────┐            |
    yusef   sara       pandunia       dunia
                                        |
                                       bon

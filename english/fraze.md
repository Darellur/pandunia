# Basic words and phrases

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

English speakers will find it easy to make basic sentences in Pandunia as the word order is generally the same as in English, there are no definite or indefinite articles, no verb "to be", and no complicated rules about changing the form of words to express singular and plural or the tense of verbs.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you! Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone. Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on. As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the language. You can just speak Pandunia!




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam**
Hello!

**salam subá!**
Good morning!

**salam den!**
Good day!

**salam xam!**
Good evening!

**salam noce!**
Good night!

**salam nyam!**
Bon appetit!

**salam lay!**
Welcome!

**salam cute!**
Goodbye!

**salam safar!**
Have a safe journey!

**salam son!**
Sleep well!

As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!

**Salam** is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and non-religious people in many different countries around the world.

<small>Etymology. **salam**
is from Arabic: سَلَام‏ "salām", Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם‏ "šalom", Turkish: selam, Hindi: सलाम "salām", Swahili: salaam, Indonesian: selamat.</small>



### mi <small>I, me</small>

**mi sara.**
I'm Sara.

**mi tomas.**
I'm Thomas.

You can introduce yourself simply by saying **mi** and your name. You don't need a verb for saying it in Pandunia!

**mi salama mamá.**
I greet mother.

**mi salama papá.**
I greet father.

The word **salam** is a noun and **salama** is the corresponding verb. The basic word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object.

**sara salama tomas.**
Sara greets Thomas.

**salam mamá!**
Greetings, mother!

**salam papá!**
Greetings, father!

<small>Etymology. **mi**
is from English: me, Italian: mi, Swahili: mimi, Zulu: -mi-.</small>




### tu <small>you</small>

**tu tomas.**
You are Thomas.

**mi salama tu.**
I greet you.

**tu salama mi.**
You greet me.

Pronouns don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **mi**
is the same in subject and object positions while English has two different forms, 'I' and 'me'.

**mi ama tu.**
I love you.

<small>Etymology. **tu**
is from Spanish: "tú", Italian: "tu", French: "tu", Hindi: तू  "tū", Farsi: تو‏‎ "to", Tajik: ту "tu".</small>



### ye <small>he, she or it</small>

**ye man.**
He is a man.

**ye fem.**
She is a woman.

**ye aple.**
It is an apple.

**ye**
is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as for things.

**mi salama ye.**
I greet him/her.

<small>Etymology. **ye** is from Lingala: yé, Swahili: yeye, Chichewa: iye, Zulu: -ye-, Hindi: यह  "ye".</small>



### eska <small>to ask a question</small>

**eska tu tomas?**
Are you Thomas?

**eska tu dotor?**
Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **eska**. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from **mi eska tu dotor.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

**eska tu bon?**
How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)  
**mi bon.**
I'm good.  
**eska tu?**
And you?  
**mi no bon.**
I'm not good.

<small>Etymology. **eska**
is from Hindi: क्या  "kyā", Urdu: كيا‏‎ "kyā".</small>



### si <small>yes</small>

**eska tu tomas?**
Are you Thomas.

**si, mi tomas.**
Yes, I am Thomas.

**eska ye dotor?**
Is he/she a doctor?

**si, ye dotor.**
Yes, he is a doctor.

The word **si** can be used also for stating something as a fact. Then it is used in place of "to be".

**mi si tomas.**
I am Thomas.

**tu si sara.**
You are Sara.

**aple si pal.**
The apple is a fruit.

Note: It is necessary to use **si** in the latest phrase because, without it, the phrase would look like a compound word: **aple pal** (an apple fruit).

<small>Etymology. **si**
is from Spanish: si, Portuguese: sim, Mandarin: 是 "shì", Shanghaiese: 是 "sí".</small>



### no <small>no, not</small>

**mi no sara.**
I'm not Sara.

**mi no dotor.**
I'm not a doctor.

**eska tu bon?**
Are you well?  
**si. mi bon.**
Yes, I'm well.

**eska tu bon?**
Are you well?  
**no, mi no bon.**
No, I'm not well.

You can use **no** to deny anything. It is placed before the word that is denied.

**ye no salama mi.**
He/she doesn't greet me.

<small>Etymology. **no**
is from English: no, Spanish: no, French: non.</small>



### men <small>people</small>

Add **men** to a singular pronoun to make it plural.

**mimen salama tumen.**
We greet you all.

**tumen salama yemen.**
You greet them.

**yemen salama mimen!**
They greet us.

**mimen fem.**

### ce <small>this, that</small>

**ce ke? / ke ce?**
What's this?

**ce aple.**
This is an apple.

**ce ros aple.**
This is a red apple.

**ci aple ros.**
This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **ros**, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.

**ye ros.**
It's red.



### da <small>'s (possessive particle)</small>

**ce ke?**
What's this?

**ce mi da fon.**
It's my phone.

**ce ke da?**

Note: Possessive particle **da** is put between the owner and the owned thing. So **mi da**
means "my", **tu da** means "your" and so on.

**ye ke?**
Who's he/she?

**ye si mi da doste.**
He/she is my friend.

**mi si sara da doste.**
I am Sara's friend.

<small>Etymology. **da**

**eska tu wol nyama?**

# Basic words and phrases

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

English speakers will find it easy to make basic sentences in Pandunia as the word order is generally the same as in English, there are no definite or indefinite articles, no verb "to be", and no complicated rules about changing the form of words to express singular and plural or the tense of verbs.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you! Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone. Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on. As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the language. You can just speak Pandunia!




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam** Hello!

**salam suba!** Good morning!

**salam den!** Good day!

**salam xam!** Good evening!

**salam noce!** Good night!

**salam yem!** Bon appetit!

**salam lai!** Welcome!

**salam go!** Goodbye!

**salam safar!** Have a safe journey!

**salam son!** Sleep well!

As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!

**Salam** is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and non-religious people in many different countries around the world.

<small>Etymology. **salam** is from Arabic: سَلَام‏ (salām), Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם‏ (šalom), Turkish: selam, Hindi: सलाम (salām), Swahili: salaam, Indonesian: selamat.</small>



### me <small>I, me</small>

**me sara.** I'm Sara.

**me tomas.** I'm Thomas.

You can introduce yourself simply by saying **me** and your name. You don't need a verb for saying it in Pandunia!

**me salama ma.** I greet mother.

**me salama pa.** I greet father.

The word **salam** functions both as a noun and as a verb. The basic word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object.

**sara salam tomas.** Sara greets Thomas.

**salam ma!** Greetings, mother!

**salam pa!** Greetings, father!

<small>Etymology. **me** is from English: me, Spanish: me, Hindi: मैं (mẽ), Punjabi: ਮੈਂ (mẽ).</small>




### ni <small>you</small>

**ni tomas.** You are Thomas.

**me salam ni.** I greet you.

**ni salam me.** You greet me.

Pronouns don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **me** is the same in subject and object positions while English has two different forms, 'I' and 'me'.

**me ama ni.** I love you.

<small>Etymology. **ni** is from Mandarin: 你 (nǐ), Cantonese: 你 (nei), Tamil: நீ  (nī).</small>



### ta <small>he, she or it</small>

**ta man.** He is a man.

**ta fem.** She is a woman.

**ta pingo.** It is an apple.

**ta** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as for things.

**me salam ta.** I greet him/her.

<small>Etymology. **ta** is from Mandarin: 他/她 (tā), Estonian: ta.</small>



### kia <small>to ask a question</small>

**kia ni tomas?** Are you Thomas?

**kia ni doktor?** Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **kia**. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from **me kia ni doktor.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

**kia ni bon?** How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)  
**me bon.** I'm good.  
**kia ni?** And you?  
**me no bon.** I'm not good.

<small>Etymology. **kia** is from Hindi: क्या  "kyā", Urdu: كيا‏‎ "kyā".</small>



### ye <small>yes</small>

**kia ni tomas?** Are you Thomas.

**ye, me tomas.** Yes, I am Thomas.

**kia ta doktor?** Is he/she a doctor?

**ye, ta doktor.** Yes, he is a doctor.

The word **ye** can be used also for stating something as a fact. Then it is used in place of "to be".

**me ye tomas.** I am Thomas.

**ni ye sara.** You are Sara.

**pingo ye pal.** The apple is a fruit.

Note: It is necessary to use **ye** in the latest phrase because, without it, the phrase would look like a compound word: **pingo pal** (an apple fruit).

<small>Etymology. **ye** is from English: yeah, Korean: 예 (ye), Luganda: yee.</small>



### no <small>no, not</small>

**me no sara.** I'm not Sara.

**me no doktor.** I'm not a doctor.

**kia ni bon?** Are you well?  
**ye. me bon.** Yes, I'm well.

**kia ni bon.** Are you well?  
**no, me no bon.** No, I'm not well.

You can use **no** to deny anything. It is placed before the word that is denied.

**ta no salam me.** He/she doesn't greet me.

<small>Etymology. **no** is from English: no, Spanish: no, French: non.</small>



### x2 <small>plural</small>

Repeat the singular pronoun to make it plural.

**meme salam nini.** We greet you all.

**nini salam tata.** You greet them.

**tata salam meme!** They greet us.

**meme fem.** We are women.

**nini man.** You are men.

**tata pingo.** They are apples.



### ke? <small>what? who?</small>

**ke?** What?

**ni ke?** Who are you?  
**me tomas.** I'm Thomas.

**ta ke?** Who is he/she?  
**ta sara.** She is Sara.

**nini ke?** Who are you people?

**tata ke?** Who are they?

<small>Etymology. **ke** is from Spanish: qué, Portuguese: que, Italian: che, Bengali: কী "ki".</small>



### sa <small>this, that</small>

**sa e ke? / ke e sa?** What's this?

**sa e pingo.** This is an apple.

**sa e ros pingo.** This is a red apple.

**sa pingo ros.** This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **ros**, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.

**ta ros.** It's red.



### su <small>'s (possessive particle)</small>

**sa ke?** What's this?

**sa me su fon.** It's my phone.

**sa ke su?** Whose is this?

**sa me su.** It's mine.

Note: Possessive particle **su** is put between the owner and the owned thing. So **me su** means "my", **ni su** means "your" and so on.

**ta ke?** Who's he/she?

**ta e me su panyo.** He/she is my friend.

**me e sara su panyo.** I am Sara's friend.

<small>Etymology. **su** is from English: 's, Afrikaans: se, Spanish: su, Portuguese: su.</small>



### nam <small>name</small>

**ni su nam e ke?** What's your name?

**me su nam e tomas.** My name is Thomas.

**ta nam ke?** What he/she is called?

### ha <small>have</small>

**me ha bon dom.** I have a good house.

## Part 2: Eating


### yem <small>consume, eat, drink</small>

**kia ni wol yem yo?** Would you like to eat something?

**ta yem pingo.** He/she eats an apple.

**tata yem pingo.** They eat apples.

Note: Unlike English, Pandunia doesn't have separate singular and plural forms. Therefore a word like **pingo** can refer to one or more apples.

**kia ni yem kafe?** Do you drink coffee?

**me yem kafe.** I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **yem** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at first but soon you will see that it is quite handy! Usually the object of the verb tells is it about eating, drinking or both.

**me yem kafe i pan.** I'm having coffee and bread.



### wol <small>want</small>

**kia ni wol yem?** Would you like to eat?

**ni wol yem ke?** What would you like to eat?

Tip: While English puts the "what" at the beginning of a question, in Pandunia the word order is not affected by the **ke**.

**me wol yem kafe.** I want to drink coffee.

**kia ni wol yem ca?** Would you like to drink tea?  
**no. me no wol ca. me wol kafe.** No, I don't want tea. I want coffee.

# Basic words and phrases

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

English speakers will find it easy to make basic sentences in Pandunia as the word order is generally the same as in English, there are no definite or indefinite articles, no verb "to be", and no complicated rules about changing the form of words to express singular and plural or the tense of verbs.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you! Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone. Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on. As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the language. You can just speak Pandunia!




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam** Hello!

**salam suba!** Good morning!

**salam den!** Good day!

**salam xam!** Good evening!

**salam noce!** Good night!

**salam nyam!** Bon appetit!

**salam laye!** Welcome!

**salam cute!** Goodbye!

**salam safar!** Have a safe journey!

**salam son!** Sleep well!

As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!

**Salam** is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and non-religious people in many different countries around the world.

<small>Etymology. **salam** is from Arabic: سَلَام‏ "salām", Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם‏ "šalom", Turkish: selam, Hindi: सलाम "salām", Swahili: salaam, Indonesian: selamat.</small>



### mi <small>I, me</small>

**mi sara.** I'm Sara.

**mi tomas.** I'm Thomas.

You can introduce yourself simply by saying **mi** and your name. You don't need a verb for saying it in Pandunia!

**mi salama ma.** I greet mother.

**mi salama pa.** I greet father.

The word **salam** is a noun and **salama** is the corresponding verb. The basic word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object.

**sara salama tomas.** Sara greets Thomas.

**salam ma!** Greetings, mother!

**salam pa!** Greetings, father!

<small>Etymology. **mi** is from English: me, Italian: mi, Swahili: mimi, Zulu: -mi-.</small>




### tu <small>you</small>

**tu tomas.** You are Thomas.

**mi salama tu.** I greet you.

**tu salama mi.** You greet me.

Pronouns don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **mi** is the same in subject and object positions while English has two different forms, 'I' and 'me'.

**mi ama tu.** I love you.

<small>Etymology. **tu** is from Spanish: "tú", Italian: "tu", French: "tu", Hindi: तू  "tū", Farsi: تو‏‎ "to", Tajik: ту "tu".</small>



### ye <small>he, she or it</small>

**ye man.** He is a man.

**ye fem.** She is a woman.

**ye pingo.** It is an apple.

**ye** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as for things.

**mi salama ye.** I greet him/her.

<small>Etymology. **ye** is from Lingala: yé, Swahili: yeye, Chichewa: iye, Zulu: -ye-, Hindi: यह  "ye".</small>



### kia <small>to ask a question</small>

**kia tu tomas?** Are you Thomas?

**kia tu doktar?** Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **kia**. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from **mi kia tu doktar.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

**kia tu bon?** How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)  
**mi bon.** I'm good.  
**kia tu?** And you?  
**mi no bon.** I'm not good.

<small>Etymology. **kia** is from Hindi: क्या  "kyā", Urdu: كيا‏‎ "kyā".</small>



### si <small>yes</small>

**kia tu tomas?** Are you Thomas.

**si, mi tomas.** Yes, I am Thomas.

**kia ye doktar?** Is he/she a doctor?

**si, ye doktar.** Yes, he is a doctor.

The word **si** can be used also for stating something as a fact. Then it is used in place of "to be".

**mi si tomas.** I am Thomas.

**tu si sara.** You are Sara.

**pingo si pal.** The apple is a fruit.

Note: It is necessary to use **si** in the latest phrase because, without it, the phrase would look like a compound word: **pingo pal** (an apple fruit).

<small>Etymology. **si** is from Spanish: si, Portuguese: sim, Mandarin: 是 "shì", Shanghaiese: 是 "sí".</small>



### no <small>no, not</small>

**mi no sara.** I'm not Sara.

**mi no doktar.** I'm not a doctor.

**kia tu bon?** Are you well?  
**si. mi bon.** Yes, I'm well.

**kia tu bon?** Are you well?  
**no, mi no bon.** No, I'm not well.

You can use **no** to deny anything. It is placed before the word that is denied.

**ye no salama mi.** He/she doesn't greet me.

<small>Etymology. **no** is from English: no, Spanish: no, French: non.</small>



### men <small>people</small>

Add **men** to a singular pronoun to make it plural.

**mimen salama tumen.** We greet you all.

**tumen salama yemen.** You greet them.

**yemen salama mimen!** They greet us.

**mimen fem.** We are women.

**tumen man.** You are men.

**yemen pingo.** They are apples.

<small>Etymology. **men** is from Mandarin: 们 "men", English: men (people in general).</small>



### ke? <small>what? who?</small>

**ke?** What?

**tu ke?** Who are you?  
**mi tomas.** I'm Thomas.

**ye ke?** Who is he/she?  
**ye sara.** She is Sara.

**tumen ke?** Who are you people?

**yemen ke?** Who are they?

<small>Etymology. **ke** is from Spanish: qué, Portuguese: que, Italian: che, Bengali: কী "ki".</small>



### li <small>this, that</small>

**li si ke? / ke si li?** What's this?

**li si pingo.** This is an apple.

**li si ros pingo.** This is a red apple.

**li pingo ros.** This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **ros**, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.

**ye ros.** It's red.



### da <small>'s (possessive particle)</small>

**li ke?** What's this?

**li si mi da fon.** It's my phone.

**li si ke da?** Whose is this?

**li si mi da.** It's mine.

Note: Possessive particle **da** is put between the owner and the owned thing. So **mi da** means "my", **tu da** means "your" and so on.

**ye ke?** Who's he/she?

**ye si mi da doste.** He/she is my friend.

**mi si sara da doste.** I am Sara's friend.

<small>Etymology. **da** is from Punjabi: ਦਾ "dā", Mandarin: 的 "de".</small>



### nam <small>name</small>

**tu da nam si ke?** What's your name?

**mi da nam si tomas.** My name is Thomas.

**ye namu ke?** What he/she is called?

<small>Etymology. **nam** is from Hindi: नाम  "nām", Farsi: نام‏‎ "nām", Thai: นาม "naam", Indonesian: nama, Japanese: 名前 "namae", German: Name, English: name.</small>

**ye nyama pingo.** He/she eats an apple.

**yemen nyama pingo.** They eat apples.

Note: Unlike English, Pandunia doesn't have separate singular and plural forms. Therefore a word like **pingo** can refer to one or more apples.

**kia tu nyama kafe?** Do you drink coffee?

**mi nyama kafe.** I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **nyama** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at first but soon you will see that it is quite handy! Usually the object of the verb tells is it about eating, drinking or both.

**mi nyama kafe i pang.** I'm having coffee and bread.



### wol <small>want</small>

**kia tu wol nyama?** Would you like to eat?

**mi wol nyama kafe.** I want to drink coffee.

**kia tu wol nyama ca?** Would you like to drink tea?  
**no. mi no wol ca. mi wol kafe.** No, I don't want tea. I want coffee.

## Introduction

Many believe that the world language should be an _isolating language_. An isolating language is completely free of inflections. Instead, it uses supplementary words, word order, and context to create meaning.

In Isolating Pandunia words are just references to things of the outside world. They don't carry any information about grammatical properties like part-of-speech.

All the grammar happens in the level of word order. A sentence is greater than the sum of the words that comprise it.

## Is grammar needed?

.desen[üë¶]

|             |           |
|:------------|:----------|
| Name:       | John      |
| Age:        | 10 years  |
| Occupation: | schoolboy |
| Hometown:   | London    |
| Eye color:  |¬†blue      |
| Hair color: | brown     |

So much can be told seemingly without any grammar!  
How is it possible?

## Zero be

The "zero be" is the absence of the verb "to be". It is a common phenomenon in many languages and also sometimes in English in casual speech.

Russian uses famously "zero be".

–ö–æ—à–∫–∞ - –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ.  
(Ko≈°ka - ≈æivotnoye.)  
Cat - animal.

Russian needs only two words to say the same that English says in five words: The cat is an animal. Pandunia can be as economical as Russian.

**mau - hewan.**

---

## Separating words

Two consecutive nouns might sound like a compound word if they are not clearly separated.

The words can be separated by a silent pause.

**mau - hewan.**


---

## Separating words

It's also possible to insert an audible pause. In Pandunia, **e** is a similar gap filler like "uh" is in English.

**mau e hewan.**  
_Cat, uh, animal._


---

## Separating words

One more possibility is to use a demonstrative pronoun.

**mau ci hewan.**  
_Cat this animal._


This method is often used in Russian.

–ö–æ—à–∫–∞ - —ç—Ç–æ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ.  
(Ko≈°ka - eto ≈æivotnoye.)  
_Cat - this animal._

---

## NP + NP = zero be

A basic "zero be" sentence consists of two noun phrases.

**la mau un hewan.** = That cat (is) an animal.  
**ci hewan un mau.** = This animal (is) a cat.  



---

## What is a verb?

In English a verb is a word that expresses an action, an occurrence or a state of being. It is a _part of speech_ that changes form for tense, aspect, mood, and voice. These _inflections_ are associated so closely to verbs that it can even feel odd to imagine verbs without them.

In Pandunia all words are unchanging ‚Äì also verbs! So a verb is simply a word that expresses an action. It is not a separate part of speech from other content words.

**pensa.** = Thought.


---

## Subject and verb

The action is usually produced by somebody. A thought is somebody's thought. That somebody is the subject of the action.

**mau pensa.** = The cat's thought.

But look! This sentence can be translated also in another way ‚Äì with a verb!

**mau pensa.** = The cat thought (or thinks or will think).


---

## Different focus: noun & verb

These two sentences, "The cat thought" and "The cat's thought", express the same situation. Drawn as an image, both of them would look the same.

.desen[üêàüí≠]

The difference (in English) is in the focus. The first focuses on the thought as an action. The second focuses on the thought as a thing. One is a verb (i.e. an action word) and the other is a noun.

This difference in focus is not necessary for describing the situation. It is only a convention of the English language.


---

## Sentence with an object

As we learned before, two noun phrases can be combined into one "zero be" sentence.

We can use it to simulate a sentence with a subject, a verb and an object.

.desen[üêàüí≠üêÅ]

**mau pensa - mux.**  
= The cat's thought (is) a mouse.  
= The cat thought (of) a mouse.

Note that the resulting word order is naturally subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject (SVO).


---

## Filling the silence

It would be awkward to pause always before the object. So this is a good place to use an appropriate filler word.

**mau pensa ci mux.**  
= _Cat thought this mouse._  
= The cat thought (of) this mouse.

Or maybe...

**mau pensa un mux.**  
= _Cat thought some mouse._  
= The cat thought (of) a mouse.




---

## Only one rule?

Basically there has been only one rule in this grammar so far: A word or phrase modifies the next one.

- An adjective modifies the following noun.
- A "verb phrase" modifies the object.

This is why isolating Pandunia can work as a very basic, almost grammarless contact language (like _pidgin English_ and _broken English_).


---

## Verb = Passive participle

Sentences like before work only if the action word is seen as a passive participle. Words like "thought" and "eaten" are passive participles, whereas "thinking" and "eating" are active participles.

**ci mau pensa un mux.**  
‚úì This cat's thought (is) a mouse.  
‚úó This cat's thinking (is) a mouse.  

**ci mau yem un mux.**  
‚úì This cat's eaten (is) a mouse.  
‚úó This cat's eating (is) a mouse.  


---

## Object fronting

The word order can be changed from SVO to OSV. Simply move the object to the beginning!

.desen[üêÅüêàüí≠]

**mux - mau pensa.**  
= Mouse (is) cat's thought.  
= (It's) the mouse (that) the cat thought.


---

## Object fronting 2

With object fronting it's easier to understand why verbs must be thought of as passive instead of active.

**un mux ci mau pensa.**  
‚úì A mouse (is) this cat's thought.  
‚úó A mouse (is) this cat's thinking.  

**un mux ci mau yem.**  
‚úì A mouse (is) this cat's eaten.  
‚úó A mouse (is) this cat's eating.  


---

## Object fronting 3

Thanks to object fronting, questions can begin with a question word.

**ke tu wol?**  
= What (is) your wanted.  
= What do you want?

In addition, object fronting can be used to emphasize the object.

**tu mi wol.**  
= You (are) my wanted.  
= You, I want.


---

## Serial verb = modifier + noun

Thinking of verbs as passive participles makes it possible to chain action words into _serial verbs_. So, in Pandunia, a serial verb is simply an adjective and a noun.

**la mau wol pensa un mux.**  
= That cat's wanted thought (is) a mouse.  
= That cat wants (to) think (of) a mouse.


---

## Pivot construction

In the pivot construction, the object of the first verb functions as the subject of the next verb.

The pivot construction is simply three consecutive noun phrases.

**un waf wol un mau yem un mux.**  
= A dog's wanted (is) a cat's eaten (is) a mouse.  
= A dog wants (that) a cat eats a mouse.

(The last noun phrase is modified by the first two together. Naturally object fronting is impossible with the pivot construction.)


---

## Clearing ambiguity

Sometimes a sentence can be interpreted in more than one way because it's unclear where the verb begins.

**nas dans dans.**  
Interpretation 1: A folk dance (is) a dance.  
Interpretation 2: A folk dances a dance.

It can be clarified by adding a simple tense or mood marker.

**nas ja dans dans.**  
= A folk already danced a dance.



---

## Summary

Verbs are not necessary as a separate part of speech.

Verb phrases can be simulated by noun phrases.

In this system, the natural word order is subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject.

Both the serial verb construction and the pivot construction can be supported by this grammar.

Ambiguity can be cleared by adding more words. No need to add more grammatical categories!

## Reasons for isolating grammar

- Extremely simple to learn
- No need for part-of-speech marking
    - No need for _root + suffix_ structure
- Words can be of any size and shape
    - All kinds of words can be borrowed to Pandunia
- Can be written in any kind of writing system
    - alphabetic script like the Latin alphabet
    - pictographic scripts
        - Chinese characters
        - Egyptian hieroglyphics
        - emoji

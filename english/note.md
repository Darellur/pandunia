# Notes about Pandunia
 
This page contains mixed notes that I have written down. They deal with all kinds of questions about Pandunia. Some of the notes can be moved to more appropriate documents later.
 
 
### Word building

Esperanto's mal- prefix means something that is at the opposite end of a continuum. For example, there is a continuum of temperature from cold to hot (malvarma, varma) and there is a continuum of beaty from ugly to beatiful (malbona, bona). A bad side of this idea is that one extreme has to be selected as the unprefixed norm.
 
That's why I prefer another way, which uses degree words and neutral nouns. Examples:
 
**bon rupi** = good-looking i.e. beautiful or handsome  
**mal rupi** = bad-looking i.e. ugly  
 
**day badani** = big-bodied i.e. large  
**lil badani** = little-bodied i.e. small  
 
In fact these are sequences of two modifiers where the first one modifies the second one. So basically the sequence is adverb + adjective.
 
On the other hand, **rup-bon** and **badan-day** are not possible compound words in Pandunia, because it's not possible to combine a noun to a modifier. That's because the modifier always modifies the noun and never the other way round.
 
However, it's possible to say:
 
**rupi bon** = looking-wise good  
**badani day** = body-wise big, bodily big, corpulent

I noticed the conflict between help and medium. That's why help was **mede** and medium was **midi** so they have different vowels. However, it's better to use **helpe** as the word for help and **medi** as the word for medium.
 
The call for help should be internationally recognized and English "help" is most widely known (besides international calls for help, S.O.S. and mayday).
 
**helpa mi!** = Help me!

Voiced sibilants, stops and affricates are not allowed in end of word position. Therefore "dez" is impossible word for Pandunia.
